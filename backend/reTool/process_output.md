This sounds like a problem involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem or something like that. Let me recall. The Chinese Remainder Theorem helps solve systems of congruences when the moduli are coprime. Are 5 and 7 coprime? Yes, their greatest common divisor is 1. So that should work.\n\nLet me write down the two congruences:\n\nFirst, the number, let's call it N, satisfies:\n\nN \u2261 4 mod 5\n\nand\n\nN \u2261 6 mod 7\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integer N that satisfies both of these. Let me think of how to approach this.\n\nOne method is to list numbers that are congruent to 4 mod 5 and then check which one is congruent to 6 mod 7. Since 4 mod 5 means numbers like 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49, 54, 59, 64, 69, 74, 79, 84, 89, 94, 99, 104, etc. Then I can check each of these numbers to see if they leave a remainder of 6 when divided by 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more systematic way without listing all possibilities. Let me try both approaches to verify.\n\nFirst, let's try the list approach.\n\nStarting with N=4. 4 divided by 7 is 0 with remainder 4. Not 6. Next, 4 +5=9. 9 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 2. Not 6. Then 14: 14 divided by 7 is 2 with remainder 0. Not 6. Next, 19: 19 divided by 7 is 2*7=14, so remainder 5. Not 6. Then 24: 24 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, remainder 3. Not 6. Next, 29: 29 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 1. Not 6. Then 34: 34 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 6. Wait, 34 divided by 7 gives 4*7=28, 34-28=6. So remainder 6. That's exactly what we want. So 34 is congruent to 6 mod 7. And 34 divided by 5 is 6*5=30, remainder 4. So yes, 34 satisfies both conditions. So the smallest positive integer is 34.\n\nBut maybe there's a smaller number? Let's check numbers less than 34. The next number after 4 in the list was 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34. So 34 is the first one that works. Therefore, 34 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the algebraic method. Let me set up the equations.\n\nWe have N \u2261 4 mod 5. So we can write N as 5k + 4 for some integer k.\n\nThen, substitute this into the second equation: 5k + 4 \u2261 6 mod 7. Let's solve for k.\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides: 5k \u2261 2 mod 7.\n\nSo we need to solve 5k \u2261 2 mod 7. Let's find the inverse of 5 modulo 7. Since 5 and 7 are coprime, the inverse exists. Let's find a number m such that 5m \u2261 1 mod 7.\n\nTrying m=3: 5*3=15, 15 mod 7 is 1. Yes, 3 is the inverse of 5 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides of 5k \u2261 2 mod 7 by 3 gives:\n\nk \u2261 2*3 mod 7\n\nk \u2261 6 mod 7\n\nSo k is congruent to 6 mod 7. Therefore, k can be written as 7m + 6 for some integer m.\n\nSubstituting back into N=5k +4: N=5*(7m +6) +4=35m +30 +4=35m +34.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are all numbers congruent to 34 mod 35. The smallest positive integer is 34.\n\nSo both methods lead to the same answer. That's good. Therefore, 34 is the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 and 6 when divided by 7.",

  "content": "Okay, so I need to find all triples of three-digit positive integers x, y, z such that x < y < z, they are in arithmetic progression, and when you add 1000 to z, they form a geometric progression. The answer should be in the form (k, m, n), and I need to find k + m + n. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since x, y, z are in arithmetic progression (AP), that means the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, the middle term y is the average of x and z. Therefore, we can write:\n\ny = x + d\n\nz = y + d = x + 2d\n\nWhere d is the common difference. Since x, y, z are three-digit numbers, x must be between 100 and 999, y must be between x+1 and 999, and z must be between y+1 and 999. So, the common difference d has to be at least 1, and the maximum possible d would be such that z = x + 2d is still a three-digit number. So, x + 2d \u2264 999. Since x \u2265 100, the maximum d would be (999 - x)/2. But since x is variable, maybe it's easier to keep that in mind for later.\n\nNow, the other condition is that x, y, z + 1000 are in geometric progression (GP). In a geometric progression, each term is multiplied by a common ratio r. So, starting with x, the next term is y, and the term after that is z + 1000. Therefore, we have:\n\ny = x * r\n\nz + 1000 = y * r = x * r^2\n\nBut we already have expressions for y and z in terms of x and d. Let's substitute those in.\n\nFrom the AP:\n\ny = x + d\n\nz = x + 2d\n\nFrom the GP:\n\ny = x * r => x + d = x * r => d = x(r - 1)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nz + 1000 = y * r => (x + 2d) + 1000 = (x + d) * r\n\nSubstituting d = x(r - 1) into the second equation:\n\n(x + 2x(r - 1)) + 1000 = (x + x(r - 1)) * r\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nx + 2x(r - 1) = x + 2xr - 2x = x(1 + 2r - 2) = x(2r - 1)\n\nSo left side becomes x(2r - 1) + 1000\n\nRight side:\n\n(x + x(r - 1)) * r = x(1 + r - 1) * r = x(r) * r = x r^2\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\nx(2r - 1) + 1000 = x r^2\n\nLet's rearrange this:\n\nx r^2 - x(2r - 1) = 1000\n\nFactor x:\n\nx (r^2 - 2r + 1) = 1000\n\nNotice that r^2 - 2r + 1 is (r - 1)^2. So,\n\nx (r - 1)^2 = 1000\n\nSo x = 1000 / (r - 1)^2\n\nBut x has to be a three-digit integer, so 100 \u2264 x \u2264 999. Also, r is a rational number because x, y, z are integers. Wait, but r could be a fraction, right? Because even if x, y, z + 1000 are integers, the ratio between them doesn't have to be an integer. For example, if x is 100, y could be 200, which would be a ratio of 2, but if y is 150, then the ratio is 1.5. So, r is a rational number. However, in order for x, y, z + 1000 to all be integers, r must be a rational number such that when you multiply x by r, you get an integer y, and then multiply y by r to get z + 1000, which is also an integer. Therefore, r must be a rational number a/b where a and b are integers that divide into x and y respectively. Hmm, maybe we can write r as a fraction in lowest terms.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote r = p/q where p and q are coprime integers. Then, since y = x * (p/q), and y has to be an integer, x must be divisible by q. Similarly, z + 1000 = y * (p/q) = x * (p/q)^2, so x must be divisible by q^2. Therefore, x is a multiple of q^2. Let's note that.\n\nBut maybe there's another way. Since we have x = 1000 / (r - 1)^2, and x is an integer, then (r - 1)^2 must be a divisor of 1000. But since r is a rational number, (r - 1) is also a rational number. So, let's write r - 1 as a fraction a/b in lowest terms, so that (r - 1) = a/b, then (r - 1)^2 = a^2 / b^2, so x = 1000 * b^2 / a^2. Since x must be an integer, a^2 must divide 1000 * b^2. But since a and b are coprime (as r - 1 is in lowest terms), then a^2 divides 1000. So, a must be a divisor of 10\u221a10. But since a must be an integer, 10\u221a10 is not an integer, so perhaps this approach is not the best.\n\nWait, maybe let's think of r - 1 as a rational number such that (r - 1)^2 divides 1000 in the sense that x is an integer. Since x = 1000 / (r - 1)^2, then (r - 1)^2 must divide 1000. But since r is a rational number, (r - 1)^2 is a positive rational number. So, (r - 1)^2 = 1000 / x. Since x is an integer between 100 and 999, 1000 / x is between approximately 1.001 and 10. So, (r - 1)^2 is between 1.001 and 10, meaning that r - 1 is between roughly 1.0005 and 3.1623. Therefore, r is between roughly 2.0005 and 4.1623. Since r is a rational number, perhaps fractions like 3/1, 5/2, 2/1, 4/1, etc. Maybe possible.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague. Let me think again.\n\nWe have x = 1000 / (r - 1)^2, which implies that (r - 1)^2 must be a divisor of 1000 in the rationals. Since x is an integer, 1000 must be divisible by (r - 1)^2. Let's represent (r - 1) as a fraction m/n where m and n are integers with no common factors. Then (r - 1)^2 = m^2 / n^2, so x = 1000 * n^2 / m^2. Since x is an integer, m^2 must divide 1000 * n^2. But since m and n are coprime, m^2 must divide 1000. Therefore, m must be a divisor of 10, because 1000 factors as 2^3 * 5^3. So the square factors of 1000 are 1, 4, 25, 100, etc. Wait, but m^2 must divide 1000. Let's factor 1000:\n\n1000 = 2^3 * 5^3\n\nSo, m^2 divides 2^3 * 5^3. Therefore, m must be a product of primes where the exponents are at most half of the exponents in 1000. So for prime 2: exponent in m^2 must be \u2264 3, so exponent in m must be \u2264 1. Similarly for prime 5: exponent in m must be \u2264 1. Therefore, m can be 1, 2, 5, or 10. Therefore, m \u2208 {1, 2, 5, 10}. Then, since (r - 1) = m/n, and m and n are coprime, n must be a positive integer coprime with m.\n\nBut x = 1000 * n^2 / m^2. Since x is a three-digit number, 100 \u2264 1000 * n^2 / m^2 \u2264 999. Let's write that as:\n\n100 \u2264 (1000 n^2) / m^2 \u2264 999\n\nDivide all parts by 1000:\n\n0.1 \u2264 n^2 / m^2 \u2264 0.999\n\nTake square roots:\n\nsqrt(0.1) \u2264 n / m \u2264 sqrt(0.999)\n\nApproximately:\n\n0.3162 \u2264 n / m \u2264 0.9995\n\nSince n and m are positive integers with m \u2208 {1, 2, 5, 10}, and n/m is between approximately 0.3162 and 1. So let's check each possible m:\n\nCase 1: m = 1\n\nThen n must satisfy 0.3162 \u2264 n / 1 \u2264 0.9995. Since n is a positive integer, n can only be 1, but 1/1 = 1, which is equal to 1, but the upper bound is 0.9995, so actually n can't be 1 here. Wait, 0.3162 \u2264 n \u2264 0.9995, but n is an integer, so there are no integers n in this interval. Therefore, m = 1 is impossible.\n\nCase 2: m = 2\n\nThen n / 2 must be between 0.3162 and 0.9995, so n must be between 0.6324 and 1.999, so n = 1. Therefore, n = 1. Check if m = 2 and n = 1 are coprime: gcd(2,1)=1, yes.\n\nSo with m = 2, n = 1:\n\nx = 1000 * (1)^2 / (2)^2 = 1000 / 4 = 250. So x = 250.\n\nThen, r - 1 = m/n = 2/1 = 2, so r = 3.\n\nCheck if this works:\n\nAP: x = 250, y = 250 + d, z = 250 + 2d. But d = x(r - 1) = 250*(3 - 1) = 250*2 = 500. Then y = 250 + 500 = 750, z = 250 + 1000 = 1250. But z has to be a three-digit number, but 1250 is four-digit. Therefore, this is invalid. So m = 2, n = 1 gives z = 1250, which is invalid. So discard this case.\n\nCase 3: m = 5\n\nThen n / 5 must be between 0.3162 and 0.9995, so n is between 1.581 and 4.9975. So possible integers n = 2, 3, 4.\n\nCheck n = 2:\n\ngcd(5,2)=1. So okay.\n\nx = 1000 * (2)^2 / (5)^2 = 1000 * 4 / 25 = 160.\n\nr - 1 = m/n = 5/2, so r = 5/2 + 1 = 7/2.\n\nThen d = x(r - 1) = 160*(5/2) = 160*2.5 = 400.\n\nSo y = x + d = 160 + 400 = 560.\n\nz = x + 2d = 160 + 800 = 960.\n\nCheck if z is three-digit: 960 is okay.\n\nNow check the GP: x, y, z + 1000 = 160, 560, 1960.\n\nCheck if 560 / 160 = 3.5 and 1960 / 560 = 3.5. Yes, 3.5 is 7/2. So the ratio is 7/2. Therefore, this works. So this is a valid triple: (160, 560, 960). Then z + 1000 is 1960, forming a GP.\n\nCheck if x, y, z are three-digit and in AP: 160 < 560 < 960, and 560 - 160 = 400, 960 - 560 = 400. So yes, AP.\n\nOkay, so this is a valid solution.\n\nNow check n = 3:\n\nx = 1000 * 3^2 / 5^2 = 1000 * 9 / 25 = 360. So x = 360.\n\nr - 1 = 5/3, so r = 8/3.\n\nThen d = x(r - 1) = 360*(5/3) = 360*(1.666...) = 600.\n\nThen y = 360 + 600 = 960.\n\nz = 360 + 1200 = 1560. Which is four-digit, so invalid. So discard.\n\nn = 4:\n\nx = 1000 * 4^2 / 5^2 = 1000 * 16 / 25 = 640.\n\nr - 1 = 5/4, so r = 9/4.\n\nThen d = 640*(5/4) = 800.\n\ny = 640 + 800 = 1440, which is four-digit. Already invalid. So discard.\n\nCase 4: m = 10\n\nThen n / 10 must be between 0.3162 and 0.9995, so n is between 3.162 and 9.995, so integers n = 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut m = 10, so we need gcd(10, n) = 1. Since m and n must be coprime.\n\nSo n must be 4,5,6,7,8,9 but coprime with 10. Therefore, n can be 7,9 (since 4 and 10 have gcd 2; 5 and 10 have gcd 5; 6 and 10 have gcd 2; 8 and 10 have gcd 2; 9 and 10 have gcd 1). So n = 7,9.\n\nCheck n = 7:\n\nx = 1000 * 7^2 / 10^2 = 1000 * 49 / 100 = 490.\n\nr - 1 = 10/7, so r = 17/7 \u2248 2.42857.\n\nThen d = x*(10/7) = 490*(10/7) = 700.\n\nSo y = 490 + 700 = 1190, which is four-digit. Invalid.\n\nn = 9:\n\nx = 1000 * 9^2 / 10^2 = 1000 * 81 / 100 = 810.\n\nr - 1 = 10/9, so r = 19/9 \u2248 2.1111.\n\nThen d = 810*(10/9) = 900.\n\nSo y = 810 + 900 = 1710, which is four-digit. Invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid case is when m = 5 and n = 2, giving x = 160, y = 560, z = 960.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all triples\". Are there any other possibilities?\n\nWait, in the above approach, we considered m as divisors of 10 (since m^2 divides 1000). But is that the only way? Because maybe there are other possibilities where (r - 1)^2 divides 1000 in the rationals but m is not a divisor of 10. Wait, but we supposed that (r - 1) = m/n in lowest terms, so m and n are coprime. Then, since x = 1000 * n^2 / m^2 must be integer, so m^2 divides 1000 * n^2. But since m and n are coprime, m^2 divides 1000. Therefore, m must be a divisor of the square root of 1000's square factors. Wait, 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3, so the square factors would be 2^2 * 5^2 = 100. Therefore, m^2 divides 1000, so m must divide 10. Therefore, m \u2208 {1, 2, 5, 10} as before.\n\nTherefore, we have considered all possible m. Therefore, the only solution is x = 160, y = 560, z = 960. Therefore, k + m + n = 160 + 560 + 960 = 1680.",

The answer should be in the form (k, m, n), and I need to find k + m + n. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since x, y, z are in arithmetic progression (AP), that means the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, the middle term y is the average of x and z. Therefore, we can write:\n\ny = x + d\n\nz = y + d = x + 2d\n\nWhere d is the common difference. Since x, y, z are three-digit numbers, x must be between 100 and 999, y must be between x+1 and 999, and z must be between y+1 and 999. So, the common difference d has to be at least 1, and the maximum possible d would be such that z = x + 2d is still a three-digit number. So, x + 2d \u2264 999.

Check if m = 2 and n = 1 are coprime: gcd(2,1)=1, yes.\n\nSo with m = 2, n = 1:\n\nx = 1000 * (1)^2 / (2)^2 = 1000 / 4 = 250. So x = 250.\n\nThen, r - 1 = m/n = 2/1 = 2, so r = 3.\n\nCheck if this works:\n\nAP: x = 250, y = 250 + d, z = 250 + 2d. But d = x(r - 1) = 250*(3 - 1) = 250*2 = 500. Then y = 250 + 500 = 750, z = 250 + 1000 = 1250. But z has to be a three-digit number, but 1250 is four-digit. Therefore, this is invalid. So m = 2, n = 1 gives z = 1250, which is invalid. So discard this case.\n\nCase 3: m = 5\n\nThen n / 5 must be between 0.3162 and 0.9995, so n is between 1.581 and 4.9975. So possible integers n = 2, 3, 4.\n\nCheck n = 2:\n\ngcd(5,2)=1. So okay.\n\nx = 1000 * (2)^2 / (5)^2 = 1000 * 4 / 25 = 160.\n\nr - 1 = m/n = 5/2, so r = 5/2 + 1 = 7/2.\n\nThen d = x(r - 1) = 160*(5/2) = 160*2.5 = 400.\n\nSo y = x + d = 160 + 400 = 560.\n\nz = x + 2d = 160 + 800 = 960.\n\nCheck if z is three-digit: 960 is okay.\n\nNow check the GP: x, y, z + 1000 = 160, 560, 1960.\n\nCheck if 560 / 160 = 3.5 and 1960 / 560 = 3.5. Yes, 3.5 is 7/2. So the ratio is 7/2. Therefore, this works. So this is a valid triple: (160, 560, 960). Then z + 1000 is 1960, forming a GP.\n\nCheck if x, y, z are three-digit and in AP: 160 < 560 < 960, and 560 - 160 = 400, 960 - 560 = 400. So yes, AP.\n\nOkay, so this is a valid solution.\n\nNow check n = 3:\n\nx = 1000 * 3^2 / 5^2 = 1000 * 9 / 25 = 360. So x = 360.\n\nr - 1 = 5/3, so r = 8/3.\n\nThen d = x(r - 1) = 360*(5/3) = 360*(1.666...) = 600.\n\nThen y = 360 + 600 = 960.\n\nz = 360 + 1200 = 1560. Which is four-digit, so invalid. So discard.\n\nn = 4:\n\nx = 1000 * 4^2 / 5^2 = 1000 * 16 / 25 = 640.\n\nr - 1 = 5/4, so r = 9/4.\n\nThen d = 640*(5/4) = 800.\n\ny = 640 + 800 = 1440, which is four-digit. Already invalid. So discard.\n\nCase 4: m = 10\n\nThen n / 10 must be between 0.3162 and 0.9995, so n is between 3.162 and 9.995, so integers n = 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut m = 10, so we need gcd(10, n) = 1. Since m and n must be coprime.\n\nSo n must be 4,5,6,7,8,9 but coprime with 10. Therefore, n can be 7,9 (since 4 and 10 have gcd 2; 5 and 10 have gcd 5; 6 and 10 have gcd 2; 8 and 10 have gcd 2; 9 and 10 have gcd 1). So n = 7,9.\n\nCheck n = 7:\n\nx = 1000 * 7^2 / 10^2 = 1000 * 49 / 100 = 490.\n\nr - 1 = 10/7, so r = 17/7 \u2248 2.42857.\n\nThen d = x*(10/7) = 490*(10/7) = 700.\n\nSo y = 490 + 700 = 1190, which is four-digit. Invalid.\n\nn = 9:\n\nx = 1000 * 9^2 / 10^2 = 1000 * 81 / 100 = 810.\n\nr - 1 = 10/9, so r = 19/9 \u2248 2.1111.\n\nThen d = 810*(10/9) = 900.\n\nSo y = 810 + 900 = 1710, which is four-digit. Invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid case is when m = 5 and n = 2, giving x = 160, y = 560, z = 960.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all triples\". Are there any other possibilities?\n\nWait, in the above approach, we considered m as divisors of 10 (since m^2 divides 1000). But is that the only way? Because maybe there are other possibilities where (r - 1)^2 divides 1000 in the rationals but m is not a divisor of 10. Wait, but we supposed that (r - 1) = m/n in lowest terms, so m and n are coprime. Then, since x = 1000 * n^2 / m^2 must be integer, so m^2 divides 1000 * n^2. But since m and n are coprime, m^2 divides 1000. Therefore, m must be a divisor of the square root of 1000's square factors. Wait, 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3, so the square factors would be 2^2 * 5^2 = 100. Therefore, m^2 divides 1000, so m must divide 10. Therefore, m \u2208 {1, 2, 5, 10} as before.\n\nTherefore, we have considered all possible m. Therefore, the only solution is x = 160, y = 560, z = 960. Therefore, k + m + n = 160 + 560 + 960 = 1680.",
