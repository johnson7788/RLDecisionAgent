0,lee cronin, every star in the sky probably has planets and life is probably emerging on these planets but i think the commentorial space associated with these planets is so different our causal cones are never going to overlap or not easily and this is the thing that makes me sad about alien life why we have to create alien life in the lab as quickly as possible because i dont know if we are going to be able to build architectures that will intersect with alien intelligence architectures
1,lex fridman, intersect you dont mean in time or space
2,lee cronin, time and the ability to communicate
3,lex fridman, the ability to communicate
4,lee cronin, yeah my biggest fear in a way is that life is everywhere but weve become infinitely more lonely because of our scaffolding in that commentorial space
5,lex fridman, the following is a conversation with lee cronin his third time in this podcast hes a chemist from university of glasgow who is one of the most fascinating brilliant and fun to talk to scientists ive ever had the pleasure of getting to know this is the lex fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends heres lee cronin
6,lex fridman,assembly theory paper
7,lex fridman, so your big assembly theory paper was published in nature congratulations
8,lee cronin, thanks
9,lex fridman, it created i think its fair to say a lot of controversy but also a lot of interesting discussion so maybe i can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if im wrong
10,lee cronin, go for it
11,lex fridman, so assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe any object that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create it and also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking at how many copies of the object there are
12,lee cronin, yep thats spot on yep
13,lex fridman, spot on
14,lee cronin, spot on
15,lex fridman, i was not expecting that okay so lets go through definitions so theres a central equation id love to talk about but definition wise what is an object
16,lee cronin, yeah an object so if im going to try to be as meticulous as possible objects need to be finite and they need to be decomposable into subunits all human made artifacts are objects is a planet an object probably yes if you scale out so an object is finite and accountable and decomposable i suppose mathematically but yeah i still wake up some days and go to think to myself what is an object because its a nontrivial question
17,lex fridman, persists over time im quoting from the paper here an object is finite is distinguishable im sure thats a weird adjective distinguishable
18,lee cronin, weve had so many people help offering to rewrite the paper after it came out you wouldnt believe its so funny
19,lex fridman, persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable
20,lee cronin, the history is in the objects its kind of cool right
21,lex fridman, okay so what defines the object is its history or memory whichever is the sexier word
22,lee cronin, im happy with both depending on the day
23,lex fridman, okay so the set of steps it took to create the object so theres a sense in which every object in the universe has a history and that is part of the thing that is used to describe its complexity how complicated it is okay what is an assembly index
24,lee cronin, so the assembly index if youre to take the object apart and be super lazy about it or minimal say cause its like youve got a really shortterm memory so what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you find the minimum number of steps you take on the path to add the parts together to reproduce the object and that minimum number is the assembly index its minimum bound and it was always my intuition the minimum bound and assembly theory was really important that i only worked out why a few weeks ago which is kind of funny cause i was just like no this is sacrosanct i dont know why itll come to me one day
25,lee cronin, and then when i was pushed by a bunch of mathematicians we came up with the correct physical explanation which i can get to but its the minimum and its really important its the minimum and the reason i knew the minimum was right is because we could measure it so almost before this paper came out wed published papers explain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules
26,lex fridman, okay so thats not so trivial to figure out so when you look at an object we could say a molecule we could say object more generally to figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object that doesnt seem like a trivial thing to do
27,lee cronin, so with molecules it is not trivial but it is possible because what you can do and because im a chemist so im kind of like i see the lens of the world for just chemistry i break the molecule apart and break bonds and if you take a molecule and you break it all apart you have a bunch of atoms and then you say okay im going to then take the atoms and form bonds and go up the chain of events to make the molecule
28,lee cronin, and thats what made me realize take a toy example literally a toy example take a lego object which is broken up of lego blocks so you could do exactly the same thing in this case the lego blocks are naturally the smallest theyre the atoms in the actual composite lego architecture but then if you maybe take a couple of blocks and put them together in a certain way maybe theyre offset in some way that offset is on the memory you can use that offset again with only a penalty of one and you can then make a square triangle and keep going
29,lee cronin, and you remember those motifs on the chain so you can then leap from the start with all the lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front of you and say right ill take you you you connect and do the least amount of work so its really like the smallest steps you can take on the graph to make the object and so for molecules it came relatively intuitively and then we started to apply it to language weve even started to apply it to mathematical theorems but im so well out of my depth but it looks like you can take minimum set of axioms and then start to build up mathematical architectures in the same way and then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that i dont yet understand
30,lex fridman, so whats the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path with molecules with language with mathematical theorems it seems like once you have the fully constructed lego castle or whatever your favorite lego world is figuring out how to get there from the basic building blocks is that an empty hard problem its a hard problem
31,lee cronin, its a hard problem but actually if you look at it so the best way to look at it lets take a molecule so if the molecule has  bonds first of all take  copies of the molecule and just cut all the bonds so cut  bonds and then you just put them in order and then thats how it works and you keep looking for symmetry or copies so you can then shorten it as you go down
32,lee cronin, and that becomes inaudible  quite hard for some natural product molecules it becomes very hard its not impossible but were looking at the bounds on that at the moment but as the object gets bigger it becomes really hard but thats the bad news but the good news is there are shortcuts and we might even be able to physically measure the complexity without computationally calculating it which is kind of insane
33,lex fridman, wait how would you do that
34,lee cronin, well in the case of molecule so if you shine light on a molecule lets take an infrared the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in what we call the fingerprint region and so its a bit like because its quantized as well you have all these discreet kind of absorbances and my intuition after we realized we could cut molecules up in mass spec that was the first go at this we did it with using infrared and the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly index and we used another technique as well in addition to infrared called nmr nuclear magnetic resonance which tells you about the number of different magnetic environments in a molecule and that also worked out so we have three techniques which each of them independently gives us the same or tending towards the same assembly index from molecule that we can calculate mathematically
35,lex fridman, so these are all methods of mass spectrometry mass spec you scan a molecule it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum and youre saying that the data correlates to the assembly index
36,lee cronin, yeah
37,lex fridman, so how generalizable is that shortcut first of all its chemistry and second of all beyond that that seems like a nice hack and youre extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry so you can say okay it kind of correlates but the whole idea behind assembly theory paper and perhaps why its so controversial is that it reaches bigger it reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe
38,lee cronin, yeah id say so id agree so ive started assembly theory of emoticons with my lab believe it or not so we take emojis pixelate them and work out the assembly index of the emoji and then work out how many emojis you can make on the path of emoji so theres the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge so you can then take a photograph and by looking at the shortest path by reproducing the pixels to make the image you want you can measure that so then you start to be able to take spatial data
39,lee cronin, now theres some problems there what is then the definition of the object how many pixels how do you break it down and so were just learning all this right now
40,lex fridman, so how do you compute begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical a set of pixels on a d plane that form a thing
41,lee cronin, so you would first of all determine the resolution so then what is your xy and what the number on the x and y plane and then look at the surface area and then you take all your emojis and make sure theyre all looked at the same resolution and then we would basically then do exactly the same thing we would do for cutting the bonds youd cut bits out of the emoji and look at youd have a bag of pixels and you would then add those pixels together to make the overall emoji
42,lex fridman, wait wait a minute but first of all not every pixels i mean this is at the core machine learning and computer vision not every pixels that important and theres macro features theres micro features and all that kind of stuff
43,lee cronin, exactly
44,lex fridman, the eyes appear in a lot of them the smile appears in a lot of them
45,lee cronin, so in the same way in chemistry we assume the bond is fundamental what we do in theyre and here is we assume the resolution at the scale at which we do it is fundamental and were just working that out and youre right that will change because as you take your lens out a bit it will change dramatically
46,lee cronin, but its just a new way of looking at not just compression what we do right now in computer science and data one big kind of misunderstanding as assembly theory is telling you about how compressed the object is thats not right its how much information is required on a chain of events because the nice thing is if when you do compression and computer science were wandering a bit here but its kind of worth wandering i think you assume you have instantaneous access to all the information in the memory in assembly theory you say no you dont get access to that memory until youve done the work and then when youve done access to that memory you can have access but not to the next one
47,lee cronin, and this is how in assembly theory we talk about the four universes the assembly universe the assembly possible and the assembly contingent and then the assembly observed and theyre all scales in this commentorial universe
48,lex fridman, yeah can you explain each one of them
49,lee cronin, yep so the assembly universe is like anything goes just combinatorial kind of explosion in everything
50,lex fridman, so thats the biggest one
51,lee cronin, thats the biggest one its massive
52,lex fridman, assembly universe assembly possible assembly contingent assembly observed and the y axis is assembly steps in time and the x axis as the thing expands through time more and more unique objects appear
53,lee cronin, yeah so assembly universe everything goes assembly possible laws of physics come in this case in chemistry bonds assembly so that means
54,lex fridman, those are extra constraints i guess
55,lee cronin, yes and theyre the only constraints theyre the constraints at the base so the way to look at its youve got all your atoms theyre contized and you can just bond them together so then you can become a kind of so in the way in computer science speak i suppose the assembly universe is just like no laws of physics things can fly through mountains beyond the speed of light in the assembly possible you have to apply the laws of physics but you can get access to all the motifs instantaneously with no effort so that means you could make anything
56,lee cronin, then the assembly contingent says no you cant have access to the highly assembled object in the future until youve done the work in the past on the causal chain and thats really the really interesting shift where you go from assembly possible to assembly contingent that is really the key thing in assembly theory that says you cannot just have instantaneous access to all those memories you have to have done the work somehow the universe has to have somehow built a system that allows you to select that path rather than other paths
57,lee cronin, and then the final thing the assembly observed is basically us saying oh these are the things we actually see we can go backwards now and understand that they have been created by this causal process
58,lex fridman, wait a minute so when you say the universe has to construct the system that does the work is that like the environment that allows for selection
59,lee cronin, yeah
60,lex fridman, so thats the thing that does the selection
61,lee cronin, you could think about in terms of a von neumann constructor versus a selection a ribosome a tesla plant assembling teslas the difference between the assembly universe in tesla land and the tesla factory is everyone says no teslas are just easy they just spring out you know how to make them all the tesla factory you have to put things in sequence and out comes a tesla
62,lex fridman, so youre talking about the factory
63,lee cronin, yes this is really nice super important point is that when i talk about the universe having a memory or theres some magic its not that its that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere in physical reality be it a cell a tesla factory or something else that is making that object im not saying theres some kind of woowoo memory in the universe morphic resonance or something im saying that there is an actual causal process that is being directed constrained in some way so its not kind of just making everything
64,lex fridman, yeah but lee whats the factory that made the factory first of all you assume the laws of physics is just sprung to existence at the beginning those are constraints but what makes the factory the environment that does the selection
65,lee cronin, this is the question of well its the first interesting question that i want to answer out of four i think the factory emerges in the interplay between the environment and the objects that are being built and let me ill have a go at explain to you the shortest path
66,lee cronin, so why is the shortest path important imagine youve got im going to have to go chemistry for a moment then abstract it so imagine youve got a given environment that you have a budget of atoms youre just flinging together and the objective of those atoms that being flung together in say molecule a they decompose so molecules decompose over time so the molecules in this environment in this magic environment have to not die but they do die they have a halflife
67,lee cronin, so the only way the molecules can get through that environment out the other side lets pretend the environment is a box and can go in and out without dying and theres just an infinite supply of atoms coming or well a large supply the molecule gets built but the molecule that is able to template itself being built and survives in the environment will basically reign supreme
68,lee cronin, now lets say that molecule takes  steps and it is using a finite set of atoms now lets say another molecule smart ass molecule well call it comes in and can survive in that environment and can copy itself but it only needs five steps the molecule that only needs five steps continued both molecules are being destroyed but theyre creating themselves faster they can be destroyed you can see that the shortest path reigns supreme so the shortest path tells us something super interesting about the minimal amount of information required to propagate that motif in time and space and it seems to be like some kind of conservation law
69,lex fridman, so one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done by the things that can construct themselves in the shortest path
70,lee cronin, yeah
71,lex fridman, so you can assume that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest in the most efficient way big leap i just took there
72,lee cronin, yeah yes and no because there are other things so in the limit yes because you want to tell the difference between things that have required a factory to build them and just random processes but you can find instances where the shortest path isnt taken for an individual object individual function and people go ah that means the shortest path isnt right and then i say well i dont know i think its right still because so of course because there are other driving forces its not just one molecule
73,lee cronin, now you start to consider two objects you have a joint assembly space and its not now its a compromise between not just making a and b in the shortest path you want to be able to make a and b in the shortest path which might mean that a is slightly longer compromise so when you see slightly more nesting in the construction when you take a given object that can look longer but thats because the overall function is the object is still trying to be efficient and this is still very hand wavy and maybe having no leg to stand on but we think were getting somewhere with that
74,lex fridman, and theres probably some parallelization right
75,lee cronin, yeah
76,lex fridman, so this is not sequential the building is i guess
77,lee cronin, no youre right
78,lex fridman, when youre talking about complex objects you dont have to work sequentially you can work in parallel you can get your friends together and they can
79,lee cronin, yeah and the thing were working on right now is how to understand these parallel processes now theres a new thing weve introduced called assembly depth and assembly depth can be lower than the assembly index for a molecule when theyre cooperating together because exactly this parallel processing is going on and my team have been working this out in the last few weeks because were looking at what compromises does nature need to make when its making molecules in a cell and i wonder if maybe like well im always leaping out of my competence but in economics im just wondering if you could apply this in economic processes it seems like capitalism is very good at finding shortest path every time and there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost function has been minimized
80,lee cronin, and so i keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity the system readjusts and finds a new shortest path but the shortest path isnt fixed on just one molecule now its in the actual existence of the object over time and that object could be a city it could be a cell it could be a factory but i think were going way beyond molecules and my competence so probably should go back to molecules but hey
81,lee cronin,assembly equation
82,lex fridman, all right before we get too far lets talk about the assembly equation okay how should we do this let me just even read that part of the paper we define assembly as the total amount of selection necessary to produce an ensemble of observed objects quantified using equation one the equation basically has a on one side which is the assembly of the ensemble and then a sum from one to n where n is the total number of unique objects
83,lex fridman, and then there is a few variables in there that include the assembly index the copy number which well talk about thats an interesting i dont remember you talking about that thats an interesting addition and i think a powerful one it has to do with what that you can create pretty complex objects randomly and in order to know that theyre not random that theres a factory involved you need to see a bunch of them thats the intuition there its an interesting intuition and then some normalization what else is and
84,lee cronin, n minus one just to make sure that more than one object one object could be a oneoff and random and then you have more than one identical object thats interesting
85,lex fridman, when theres two of a thing
86,lee cronin, two of a thing is super important especially if the index assembly index is high
87,lex fridman, so we could say several questions here one lets talk about selection what is this term selection what is this term evolution that were referring to which aspect of darwinian evolution are we referring to thats interesting here
88,lee cronin, yeah so this is probably what the paper we should talk about the paper for a second the paper what it did is it kind of annoyed we didnt know it it got intention and obviously the angry people were annoyed
89,lex fridman, theres angry people in the world thats good
90,lee cronin, so what happened is the evolutionary biologists got angry we were not expecting that we thought evolutionary biologists would be cool i knew that some not many computational complexity people will get angry because ive kind of been poking them and maybe i deserved it but i was trying to poke them in a productive way and then the physicists kind of got grumpy because the initial conditions tell everything the prebiotic chemist got slightly grumpy because theres not enough chemistry in there then finally when the creationist said it wasnt creationist enough i was like ive done my job
91,lex fridman, youre saying the physics they say because youre basically saying that physics is not enough to tell the story of how biology emerges
92,lee cronin, i think so
93,lex fridman, and then they said a few physics is the beginning and the end of the story
94,lee cronin, so what happened is the reason why people put the phone down on the call of the paper if you view reading the paper like a phone call they got to the abstract and in the abstract
95,lex fridman, first sentence is pretty strong
96,lee cronin, the first two sentences caused everybody
97,lex fridman, scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with the immutable laws of the universe defined by physics
98,lee cronin, true right theres nothing wrong with that statement totally true
99,lex fridman, yeah these laws underpin lifes origin evolution and the development of human culture and technology yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena wow first of all we should say the title of the paper this paper was accepted and published in nature the title is assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution very humble title and the entirety of the paper i think presents interesting ideas but reaches high
100,lee cronin, i am not i would do it all again this paper was actually on the preprint server for over a year
101,lex fridman, you regret nothing
102,lee cronin, yeah
103,lee cronin, i think yeah i dont regret anything
104,lex fridman, you and frank sinatra did it your way
105,lee cronin, what i love about being a scientist is sometimes because im a bit dim and i dont understand what people are telling me i want to get to the point this paper says hey the laws of physics are really cool the universe is great but they dont really its not intuitive that you just run the standard model and get life out i think most physicists might go yeah its not just we cant just go back and say thats what happened because physics cant explain the origin of life yet that doesnt mean it wont or cant okay just to be clear sorry intelligent designers we are going to get there
106,lee cronin, second point we say that evolution works but we dont know how evolution got going so biological evolution and biological selection so for me this seems like a simple continuum so when i mentioned selection and evolution in the title i think and in the abstract we should have maybe prefaced that and said nonbiological selection and nonbiological evolutions and then that might have made it even more crystal clear but i didnt think that biology evolutionary biology should be so bold to claim ownership of selection and evolution
107,lee cronin, and secondly a lot of evolutionary biologists seem to dismiss the origin of life question and just say its obvious and that causes a real problem scientifically because two different when the physicists are like  we own the universe the universe is good we explain all of it look at us and even biologists say we can explain biology and the poor chemists in the middle going but hang on
108,lee cronin, and this paper kind of says hey there is an interesting disconnect between physics and biology and thats at the point at which memories get made in chemistry through bonds and hey lets look at this close and see if we can quantify it so yeah i never expected the paper to get that much interest and still its only been published just over a month ago now
109,lex fridman, so just to link on the selection what is the broader sense of what selection means
110,lee cronin, yeah thats really good for selection so i think for selection so this is where for me the concept of an object is something that can persist in time and not die but basically can be broken up so if i was going to kind of bolster the definition of an object so if something can form and persist for a long period of time under an existing environment that could destroy other and im going to use anthropomorphic terms i apologize about weaker objects or less robust then the environment could have selected that
111,lee cronin, so good chemistry examples if you took some carbon and you made a chain of carbon atoms whereas if you took some i dont know some carbon nitrogen and oxygen and made change from those youd start to get different reactions and rearrangements so a chain of carbon atoms might be more resistant to falling apart under a acidic or basic conditions versus another set of molecules so it survives in that environment so the acid pond the resistant molecule can get through and then that molecule goes into another environment so that environment now maybe being acid pond is a basic pond or maybe its an oxidizing pond and so if youve got carbon and it goes an oxidizing pond maybe the carbon starts to oxidize and break apart so you go through all these kind of obstacle courses if you like given by reality so selection is the ability happens when object survives in an environment for some time
112,lee cronin, and this is the thing thats super subtle the object has to be continually being destroyed and made by process so its not just about the object now its about the process and time that makes it because a rock could just stand on the mountain side for  billion years and nothing happened to it and thats not necessarily really advanced selection so for selection to get really interesting you need to have a turnover in time you need to be continually creating objects producing them what we call discovery time so theres a discovery time for an object
113,lee cronin, when that object is discovered if its say a molecule that can then act on itself or the chain of events that caused itself to bolster its formation then you go from discovery time to production time and suddenly you have more of it in the universe so it could be a selfreplicating molecule and the interaction of the molecule in the environment in the warm little pond or in the sea or wherever in the bubble could then start to build a proto factory the environment
114,lee cronin, so really to answer your question what the factory is the factory is the environment but its not very autonomous its not very redundant theres lots of things that could go wrong so once you get high enough up the hierarchy of networks of interactions something needs to happen that needs to be compressed into a smaller volume and made resistant robust because in biology selection and evolution is robust that you have error correction built in you have really theres good ways of basically making sure propagation goes on
115,lee cronin, so really the difference between inorganic antibiotic selection and evolution and evolution and stuff in biology is robustness the ability to propagate the ability to survive in lots of different environments whereas our poor little inorganic sole molecule whatever just dies in lots of different environments so theres something super special that happens from the inorganic molecule in the environment that kills it to where youve got evolution and cells can survive everywhere
116,lex fridman, how special is that how do you know those kinds of evolution factors arent everywhere in the universe
117,lee cronin, i dont and im excited because i think selection isnt special at all i think what is special is the history of the environments on earth that gave rise to the first cell that now has taken all those environments and is now more autonomous and i would like to think that you know this paper could be very wrong but i dont think its very wrong i mean its certainly wrong but its less wrong than some other ideas i hope right and if this inspires us to go and look for selection in the universe because we now have an equation where we can say we can look for selection going on and say oh thats interesting we seem to have a process its giving us high copy number objects that also are highly complex but that doesnt look like life as we know it
118,lee cronin, and we use that and say oh theres a hydrothermal vent oh theres a process going on theres molecular networks because the assembly equation is not only meant to identify at the higher end advanced selection what you get i would call in biology super advanced selection and even you could use the assembly equation to look for technology and god forbid we could talk about consciousness and abstraction but lets keep it primitive molecules and biology so i think the real power of the assembly equation is to say how much selection is going on in this space
119,lee cronin, and theres a really simple thought experiment i could do is you have a little petri dish and on that petri dish you put some simple food so the assembly index of all the sugars and everything is quite low so then and you put a single cell of e coli cell and then you say im going to measure the assembly in this amount of assembly in the box so its quite low but the rate of change of assembly dadt will go inaudible  sigmoidal as it eats all the food and the number of coli cells will replicate because they take all the food they copy themselves the assembly index of all the molecules goes up up and up until the food is exhausted in the box so now the e colis stopped
120,lee cronin,  in the box so now the e colis stopped i mean die is probably a strong word they stopped respiring because all the food is gone but suddenly the amount of assembly in the box has gone up gigantically because of that one e coli factory has just eaten through milled lots of other e coli factories run out of food and stopped and so that looking at that so in the initial box although the amount of assembly was really small it was able to replicate and use all the food and go up and thats what were trying to do in the lab actually is make those experiments and see if we can spot the emergence of molecular networks that are producing complexity as we feed in raw materials and we feed a challenge an environment we try and kill the molecules and really thats the main idea for the entire paper
121,lex fridman, yeah and see if you can measure the changes in the assembly index throughout the whole system
122,lee cronin, yeah
123,lee cronin,discovering alien life
124,lex fridman, okay what about if i show up to a new planet well go to mars or some other planet from a different solar system how do we use assembly index there to discover alien life
125,lee cronin, very simply actually lets say well go to mars with a mass spectrometer with a sufficiently high resolution so what you have to be able to do so a good thing about mass spec is that you can select the molecule from the mass and then if its high enough resolution you can be more and more sure that youre just seeing identical copies you can count them and then you fragment them and you count the number of fragments and look at the molecular weight and the higher the molecular weight and the higher the number of the fragments the higher the assembly index
126,lee cronin, so if you go to mars and you take a mass spec with high enough resolution and you can find molecules a guide on earth if you could find molecules say greater than  molecular weight with more than  fragments you have found artifacts that can only be produced at least on earth by life and now you would say oh well maybe the geological process i would argue very virulently that that is not the case
127,lee cronin, but we can say look if you dont like the cutoff on earth go up higher   because theres going to be a point where you can find a molecule with so many different parts the chances of you getting a molecule that has a hundred different parts and finding a million identical copies thats just impossible that could never happen in an infinite set of universes
128,lex fridman, can you just linger on this copy number thing a million different copies what do you mean by copies and why is the number of copies important
129,lee cronin, yeah that was so interesting i always understood the copy number is really important but i never explained it properly for ages and i kept having this it goes back to this if i give you a i dont know a really complicated molecule and i say its complicated you could say hey thats really complicated but is it just really random
130,lex fridman, mmhmm
131,lee cronin, so i realized that ultimate randomness and ultimate complexity are indistinguishable until you can see a structure in the randomness so you can see copies
132,lex fridman, so copies implies structure
133,lee cronin, yeah the factory
134,lex fridman, i mean theres a deep profound thing in there because if you just have a random process youre going to get a lot of complex beautiful sophisticated things
135,lee cronin, mmhmm
136,lex fridman, what makes them complex in the way we think life is complex or yeah something like a factory thats operating under a selection processes there should be copies is there some looseness about copies what does it mean for two objects to be equal
137,lee cronin, its all to do with the telescope or the microscope youre using and so at the maximum resolution the nice thing about chemists is they have this concept of the molecule and theyre all familiar with the molecule and molecules you can hold on your hand lots of them identical copies a molecule is actually a super important thing in chemistry to say look you can have a mole of a molecules an avogadros number of molecules and theyre identical what does that mean that means that the molecular composition the bonding and so on the configuration is indistinguishable you can hold them together you can overlay them
138,lee cronin, so the way i do it is if i say heres a bag of  identical molecules lets prove theyre identical you pick one out of the bag and you basically observe it using some technique and then you take it away and then you take another one out if you observe it using technique you see no differences theyre identical its really interesting to get right because if you take say two molecules molecules can be in different vibrational rotational states theyre moving all the time
139,lee cronin, so in this respect identical molecules have identical bonding in this case we dont even talk about chirality because we dont have a chirality detector so two identical molecules in one conception assembly theory basically considers both hands as being the same but of course theyre not theyre different as soon as you have a chiral distinguisher to detect the left and the right hand they become different and so its to do with the detection system that you have and the resolution
140,lex fridman, so i wonder if theres an art and science to the which detection system is used when you show up to a new planet
141,lee cronin, yeah yeah yeah
142,lex fridman, so youre talking about chemistry a lot today we have standardized detection systems of how to compare molecules so when you start to talk about emojis and language and mathematical theorems and i dont know more sophisticated things at different scale at a smaller scale than molecules at a larger scale than molecules what detection if we look at the difference between you and me lex and lee are we the same are we different
143,lee cronin, sure i mean of course were different close up but if you zoom out a little bit we will morphologically look the same high in characteristics hair length stuff like that
144,lex fridman, well also the species and
145,lee cronin, yeah yeah yeah
146,lex fridman,  and also theres a sense why were both from earth
147,lee cronin, yeah i agree i mean this is the power of assembly theory in that regard so if everything so the way to look at it if you have a box of objects if theyre all indistinguishable then using your technique what you then do is you then look at the assembly index now if the assembly index of them is really low and theyre all indistinguishable then theyre telling you that you have to go to another resolution so that would be it is a sliding scale its nice
148,lex fridman, got it so those two are attentional with each other
149,lee cronin, yeah
150,lex fridman, the number of copies and the assembly index
151,lee cronin, yeah
152,lex fridman, thats really really interesting so okay so you show up to a new planet youll be doing what
153,lee cronin, i would do mass spec i would bring
154,lex fridman, on a sample of what first of all how big of a scoop do you take do you just take a scoop what so were looking for primitive life
155,lee cronin, i would look yeah so if youre just going to mars or titan or enceladus or somewhere so a number of ways of doing it so you could take a large scoop or you go through the atmosphere and detect stuff you could make a life meter right one of sarahs colleagues at asu paul davies keeps calling it a life meter which is quite a nice idea because you think about it if youve got a living system thats producing these highly complex molecules and they drift away and theyre in a highly demanding environment they could be burnt right so they could just be falling apart so you want to sniff a little bit of complexity and say warmer warmer warmer oh weve found life we found the alien weve found the alien elon musk smoking a joint in the bottom of the cave on mars or elon himself whatever right
156,lex fridman, yeah mmhmm
157,lee cronin, you say okay found it so what you can do is a mass spectrometer you could just look for things in the gas phase or you go on the surface drill down because you want to find molecules that are well youve either got to find the source living system because the problem with just looking for complexity is it gets burnt away so in a harsh environment on say on the surface of mars theres a very low probability that youre going to find really complex molecules because of all the radiation and so on
158,lee cronin, if you drill down a little bit you could drill down a bit into soil thats billions of years old then i would put in some solvent water alcohol or something or take a scoop make it volatile put it into the mass spectrometer and just try and detect high complexity high abundant molecules and if you get them hey presto you can have evidence of life wouldnt that then be great if you could say okay weve found evidence of life now we want to keep the life meter keep searching for more and more complexity until you actually find living cells and you can get those new living cells and then you could bring them back to earth or you could try and sequence them you could see that they have different dna and proteins
159,lex fridman, go along the gradient of the life meter
160,lee cronin, exactly
161,lex fridman, how would you build a life meter lets say were together starting new
162,lee cronin, just a mass spectrometer
163,lex fridman,  new company launching a life
164,lee cronin, mass spectrometer would be the first way of doing it just take
165,lex fridman, no no no but thats one of the major components of it but im talking about
166,lee cronin, i would
167,lex fridman,  if its a device and branding logo we got to talk about
168,lee cronin, all right
169,lex fridman,  thats later but whats the input and whats the how do you get to the metered output
170,lee cronin, so i would take a so my life meter our life meter there you go
171,lex fridman, oh thank you
172,lee cronin, yeah youre welcome would have both infrared and mass spec it would have two ports so it could shine a light and so what it would do is you would have a vacuum chamber and you would have an electrostatic analyzer and youd have a monochromator to producing infrared youd add the sum so youd take a scoop of the sample put it in the life meter it would then add a solvent or heat up the sample so some volatiles come off the volatiles would then be put into the mass into electrostatic trap and youd weigh the molecules and fragment them alternatively youd shine infrared light on them and you count number of bands but youd have to in that case do some separation because you want to separate and so in mass spec its really nice and convenient because you can separate electrostatically but you need to have that
173,lex fridman, can you do it in real time
174,lee cronin, yeah pretty much pretty much yeah so lets go all the way back okay were really going to get this
175,lex fridman, lets go
176,lee cronin,  lexs life lex and lees life meter
177,lex fridman, no i like lex and lee its a good ring to it
178,lee cronin, all right so you have a vacuum chamber you have a little nose the nose would have some a packing material so you would take your sample add it onto the nose add a solvent or a gas it would then be sucked up the nose and that would be separated using what we call chromatography and then as each band comes off the nose well then do mass spec and infrared and in the case of the infrared count the number of bands in the case of mass spec count the number of fragments and weigh it
179,lee cronin, and then the further up in molecular weight range for the mass spec and the number of bands you go up and up and up from the dead interesting interesting over the threshold oh my gosh earth life and then right up to the batshit crazy this is definitely alien intelligence thats made this life right you could almost go all the way there same in the infrared and pretty simple
180,lee cronin, the thing that is really problematical is that for many years decades what people have done and i cant blame them is theyve rather theyve been obsessing about small biomarkers that we find on earth amino acids like single amino acids or evidence of small molecules and these things and looking for those while im looking for complexity the beautiful thing about this is you can look for complexity without earth chemistry bias or earth biology bias so assembly theory is just a way of saying hey complexity in abundance is evidence of selection thats how our universal life meter will work
181,lex fridman, complexity in abundance is evidence of selection okay so lets apply our life meter to earth if we were just to apply assembly index measurements to earth what kind of stuff are going to get whats impressive about
182,lee cronin, so
183,lex fridman,  some of the complexity on earth
184,lee cronin,  so we did this a few years ago when i was trying to convince nasa and colleagues that this technique could work and honestly its so funny because everyones like no it aint going to work and it was just like because the chemists were saying of course there are complicated molecules out there you can detect that just form randomly and i was like really that was like its a bit like i dont know someone saying of course darwins textbook was just written randomly by some monkeys and a typewriter just for me it was like really and ive pushed a lot on the chemists now and i think most of them are on board but not totally i really had some big arguments but the copy number caught there because i think i confused the chemists by saying oneoff and then when i made clear about the copy number i think that made it a little bit easier
185,lex fridman, just to clarify a chemist might say that of course out there outside of earth theres complex molecules
186,lee cronin, yes
187,lex fridman, okay and then youre saying wait a minute thats like saying of course theres aliens out there like you
188,lee cronin, yeah exactly that
189,lex fridman, okay
190,lee cronin, exactly
191,lex fridman, you clarify that thats actually a very interesting question and we should be looking for complex molecules of which the copy number is two or greater
192,lee cronin, yeah exactly so on earth so coming back to earth what we did is we took a whole bunch of samples and we were running prebiotic chemistry experiments in the lab we took various inorganic minerals and extracted them look at the volatile because theres a special way of treating minerals and polymers in assembly theory in this in our life machine were looking at molecules we dont care about polymers because they dont theyre not volatile you cant hold them how can you make if you cant discern that theyre identical then its very difficult for you to work out if this undergone selection or theyre just a random mess
193,lee cronin, same with some minerals but we can come back to that so basically what you do weve got a whole loads of samples inorganic ones we got a load of we got scotch whiskey and also got
194,lex fridman, nice
195,lee cronin,  took a odd bag which is one of my favorite whiskeys which is very peaty and another
196,lex fridman, whats peaty mean
197,lee cronin, it is like so the way that in scotland in isla which is a little island the scotch the whiskey is let to mature in barrels its said that the peat the complex molecules in the peat find their way through into the whiskey and thats what gives it this intense brown color and really complex flavor its literally molecular complexity that does that and so vodkas the complete opposite its just pure right
198,lex fridman, so the better the whiskey the higher the assembly index the higher the assembly index the better the whiskey
199,lee cronin, i mean i really love deep peaty scottish whiskeys near my house there is one of the lowland distilleries called glengoyne its still beautiful whiskey but not as complex so for fun i took some glengoyne whiskey in our bag and put them into the mass spec and measured the assembly index i also got e coli so the way we do it take the e coli break the cell apart take it all apart and also got some beer and people were ridiculing us saying oh beer is evidence of complexity
200,lee cronin, and one of the computational complexity people it was just throwing yeah hes very vigorous in his disagreement of assembly theory was just saying you dont know what youre doing even beer is more complicated than human what he didnt realize is that its not beer per se its taking the yeast extract taking the extract breaking the cells extracting the molecules and just looking at the profile of the molecules see if theres anything over the threshold and we also put in a really complex molecule taxol
201,lee cronin, so we took all of these but also nasa gave us i think five samples and they wouldnt tell us what they are they said no we dont believe youre going to get this to work and they really gave us some super complex samples and they gave us two fossils one that was a million years old and one was at  years old something from antarctica seabed they gave us some murchison and meteorite and a few others put them through the system so we took all the samples treat them all identically put them into mass spec fragmented them counted
202,lee cronin, and in this case implicit in the measurement was we in mass spec you only detect peaks when youve got more than say lets say  identical molecules so the copy numbers already baked in but wasnt quantified which is super important there this was in the first paper because i was like its abundant of course
203,lee cronin, and when you then took it all out we found that the biological samples gave you molecules that had an assembly index greater than  and all the abiotic samples were less than  and then we took the nasa samples and we looked at the ones that were more than  less than  and we gave them back to nasa and theyre like oh gosh yep dead living dead living you got it and thats what we found on earth
204,lex fridman, thats a success
205,lee cronin, yeah oh yeah resounding success
206,lex fridman, can you just go back to the beer and the e coli so whats the assembly index on those
207,lee cronin, so what you were able to do is the assembly index of we found high assembly index molecules originating from the beer sample and the e coli sample
208,lex fridman, yeast in the beer
209,lex fridman,evolution of life on earth
210,lee cronin, i didnt know which one was higher we didnt really do any detail there because now we are doing that because one of the things weve done its a secret but i can tell you i think its
211,lex fridman, nobodys listening
212,lee cronin,  well is that weve just mapped the tree of life using assembly theory because everyone said  oh you cant do anything from biology and what were able to do is so i think theres three well two ways of doing tree of life well three ways actually
213,lex fridman, whats the tree of life
214,lee cronin, so the tree of life is basically tracing back the history of life on earth all the different species going back who evolved from what and it all goes all the way back to the first life forms and they branch off and you have plant kingdom the animal kingdom the fungi kingdom and different branches all the way up and the way this was classically done and im no evolutionary biologist the evolutionary biologists tell me every day at least  times i want to be one though i like biology its cool
215,lex fridman, yeah its very cool
216,lee cronin, but basically
217,lex fridman, evolutionary
218,lee cronin,  what darwin and mendeleev and all these people do is just they draw pictures and they inaudible  taxa they were able to draw pictures and say oh these look like common classes
219,lex fridman, yeah
220,lee cronin, then
221,lex fridman, theyre artists really theyre just
222,lee cronin, they were able to find out a lot right and looking at vertebrates and vertebrates cambrian explosion and all this stuff and then came the genomic revolution and suddenly everyone used gene sequencing and craig venters a good example i think hes gone around the world in his yacht just picking up samples looking for new species where hes just found new species of life just from sequencing its amazing so you have taxonomy you have sequencing and then you can also do a little bit of molecular archeology like measure the samples and form some inference
223,lee cronin, what we did is we were able to fingerprint so we took a load of random samples from all of biology and we used mass spectrometry and what we did now is not just look for individual molecules but we looked for coexisting molecules where they had to look at their joint assembly space and we were able to cut them apart and undergo recursion in the mass spec and infer some relationships and were able to recapitulate the tree of life using mass spectroscopy no sequencing and no drawing
224,lex fridman, all right can you try to say that again with a little more detail so recreating what does it take to recreate the tree of life what does the reverse engineering process look like here
225,lee cronin, so what you do is you take an unknown sample you bung it into the mass spec you get because this comes from what youre asking what do you see in e coli
226,lex fridman, mmhmm
227,lee cronin, and so in e coli you dont just see its not the most sophisticated cells on earth make the most sophisticated molecules it is the coexistence of lots of complex molecules above a threshold and so what we realized is you could fingerprint different life forms so fungi make really complicated molecules why because they cant move they have to make everything onsite
228,lee cronin, whereas some animals are lazy they can just go eat the fungi and they dont need to make very much and so what you do is you look at the so you take i dont know the fingerprint maybe the top number of high molecular weight molecules you find in the sample you fragment them to get their assembly indices and then what you can do is you can infer common origins of molecules you can do a molecular when the reverse engineering of the assembly space you can infer common roots and look at whats called the joint assembly space
229,lee cronin, but lets translate that into the experiment take a sample bung it in the mass spec take the top say  molecules fragment them and that gives you one fingerprint then you do it for another sample you get another fingerprint now the question is you say hey are these samples the same or different and thats what weve been able to do and by basically looking at the assembly space that these molecules create without any knowledge of assembly theory you are unable to do it with a knowledge of assembly theory you can reconstruct the tree
230,lex fridman, how does knowing if theyre the same or different give you the tree
231,lee cronin, lets go to two leaves on different branches on the tree right what you can do by counting the number of differences you can estimate how far away their origin was
232,lex fridman, got it
233,lee cronin, and thats what we do and it just works but when we realized you could even use assembly theory to recapitulate the tree of life with no gene sequencing we were like huh
234,lex fridman, so this is looking at samples that exist today in the world
235,lee cronin, yeah
236,lex fridman, what about things that are no longer exist i mean the tree contains information about the past
237,lee cronin, i would
238,lex fridman,  some of it is gone
239,lee cronin, yeah absolutely i would love to get old fossil samples and apply assembly theory mass spec and see if we can find new forms of life that have that are no longer amenable to gene sequencing because the dna is all gone because dna and rnas quite unstable but some of the more complex molecules might be there they might give you a hint something new or wouldnt it be great if you
240,lex fridman, i understand
241,lee cronin,  if you find a sample thats worth really persevering and doing the proper extraction to pcr and so on and then sequence it and then put it together
242,lex fridman, so when a thing dies you can still get some information about its complexity
243,lee cronin, yeah and it appears that you can do some dating now there are really good techniques theres radiocarbon dating there is longer dating going looking at radioactive minerals and so on and you can also in bone you can look at what happens after something dies is you get whats called racemization where the chirality in the polymers basically changes and you get decomposition and the deviation from the pure enantiomer to the mixture you can have it gives you a timescale on it halflife so you can date when it died i want to use assembly theory to see if i can use it and date death and things and trace the tree of life and also decomposition of molecules
244,lex fridman, do you think its possible
245,lee cronin, oh yeah without a doubt it may not be better than what i was just at conference where theres some brilliant people looking isotope enrichment and looking at how life enriches isotopes and theyre really sophisticated stuff that theyre doing but i think theres some fun to be had there because it gives you another dimension of dating how old is this molecule in terms of or more importantly how long ago was this molecule produced by life more complex the molecule the more prospect for decomposition oxidation reorganization loss of chirality and all that jazz
246,lee cronin, but what life also does is it enriches as you get older the amount of carbon in you goes up because of the way the bonding is in carbon so it has a slightly different strength bond strength than you its called a kinetic isotope effect so you can literally date how old you are or when you stop metabolizing so you could date someones how old they are i think im making this up this might be right but i think its roughly right the amount of carbon you have in you you can estimate how old you are
247,lex fridman, how old living humans are or living organism
248,lee cronin, yeah yeah you could say oh this person is  years old and this person is  years old because theyve been metabolizing more carbon and theyve accumulated it thats the basic idea its probably completely wrong timescale
249,lee cronin,response to criticism
250,lex fridman, signatures of chemistry are fascinating so youve been saying a lot of chemistry examples for assembly theory what if we zoom out and look at a bigger scale of an object like really complex objects like humans or living organisms that are made up of millions or billions of other organisms how do you try to apply assembly theory to that
251,lee cronin, at the moment we should be able to do this to morphology in cells so were looking at cell surfaces and really im to trying to extend further its just that we work so hard to get this paper out and people to start discussing the ideas but its kind of funny because i think the penny is falling on this so yeah
252,lex fridman, what does that even whats it mean for a penny to be
253,lee cronin, i mean no the pennys dropped right a lot of people were like its rubbish its rubbish youve insulted me its wrong i mean the paper got published on the th of october it had  million engagements on twitter and its been downloaded over a few hundred thousand times and someone actually said to me wrote to me and said this is an example of really bad writing and what not to do and i was like if all of my papers got read this much because thats the objective if i have a publishing a paper i want people to read it i want to write that badly again
254,lex fridman, yeah i dont know whats the deep insight here about the negativity in the space i think its probably the immune system of the scientific community making sure that theres no bullshit that gets published and that it can overfy it can do a lot of damage it can shut down conversations in a way thats not productive
255,lee cronin, and i go back i mean ill answer your question about the hierarchy in assembly but lets go back to the perception people saying the paper was badly written i mean of course we could improve it we could always improve the clarity
256,lex fridman, lets go there before we go to the hierarchy
257,lee cronin, yeah
258,lex fridman, it has been criticized quite a bit the paper what has been some criticism that youve found most powerful that you can understand and can you explain it
259,lee cronin, yes the most exciting criticism came from the evolutionary biologist telling me that he thought that origin of life was a solved problem and i was like whoa were really onto something because its clearly not and when you poked them on that they just said no you you dont understand evolution and i said no no i dont think you understand that evolution had to occur before biology and theres a gap that was really for me that misunderstanding and that did cause an immune response which was really interesting
260,lee cronin, the second thing was the fact that physicists the physicists were actually really polite really nice about it but they just said huh were not really sure about the initial conditions thing but this is a really big debate that we should certainly get into because the emergence of life was not encoded in the initial conditions of the universe and i think assembly theory shows why it cant be ill say that
261,lex fridman, okay sure if you could say that again
262,lee cronin, the origin of the emergence of life was not and cannot in principle be encoded in the initial conditions of the universe
263,lex fridman, just to clarify what you mean by life is what high assembly index objects
264,lee cronin, yeah and this goes back to your favorite subject
265,lex fridman, whats that
266,lee cronin, time
267,lex fridman, right so why what does time have to do with it
268,lee cronin, i mean probably we can come back to it later but i think it might be if we have time
269,lex fridman, yeah
270,lee cronin, but i think that i think i now understand how to explain how lots of people got angry with the assembly paper but also the ramifications of this is how time is fundamental in the universe and this notion of commentorial spaces and there are so many layers on this but you have to become an i think you have to become an intuitionist mathematician and you have to abandon platonic mathematics and also platonic mathematics is left physics astray but theres a lot to unpack there so we can go to the
271,lex fridman, platonic mathematic okay its okay the evolutionary biologists criticized because the origin of life is understood and not it doesnt require an explanation that involves physics
272,lee cronin, yeah it
273,lex fridman, thats their statement
274,lee cronin, well i mean they said lots of confusing statements basically i realized the evolutionary biology community that were vocal and some of them were really rude really spiteful and needlessly so right because look i didnt people misunderstand publication as well some of the peoples have said how dare this be published in nature what a terrible journal and it really and i watched said to people look this is a brand new idea thats not only potentially going to change the way we look at biology its going to change the way we look at the universe
275,lee cronin, and everyones saying how dare how dare you be so grandiose im like no no no this is not hype were not saying weve invented some i dont know weve discovered a alien in a closet somewhere just for hype we genuinely mean this to genuinely have the impact or asked the question and the way people jumped on that was a really bad precedent for young people who want to actually do something new
276,lee cronin, because this makes a bold claim and the chances are that its not correct but what i wanted to do is a couple of things is i wanted to make a bold claim that was precise and testable and correctable not another wooly informationinbiology argument informationchurring machine blah blah blah blah blah a concrete series of statements that can be falsified and explored and either the theory could be destroyed or built upon
277,lex fridman, well what about the criticism of youre just putting a bunch of sexy names on something thats already obvious
278,lee cronin, yeah thats really good so the assembly index of a molecule is not obvious no one had measure it before and no one has thought to quantify selection complexity and copy number before in such a primitive quantifiable way i think the nice thing about this paper
279,lee cronin,  quantifiable way i think the nice thing about this paper this paper is a tribute to all the people that understand that biology does something very interesting some people call it negentropy some people call it think about organizational principles that lots of people were not shocked by the paper because theyd done it before a lot of the arguments we got some people said oh its rubbish oh by the way i had this idea  years before i was like  which one is it the rubbish part or the really revolutionary part
280,lee cronin, so this kind of plucked two strings at once it plucked the there is something interesting that biology are we can see around this but we havent quantified yet and what this is is the first stab at quantifying that so the fact that people said this is obvious but if its obvious why have you not done it
281,lex fridman, sure but theres a few things to say there one is this is in part of philosophical framework because its not like you can apply this generally to any object in the universe its very chemistry focused
282,lee cronin, yeah well i think you will be able to we just havent got there robustly so if we can say how can we lets go up a level so if we go up from level lets go up from molecules to cells because you would jump to people and i jump to emoticons and both are good and they will be assembly
283,lex fridman, lets stick with cells yeah good point
284,lee cronin, if we go from molecules to assemblies and lets take acellular assembly a nice thing about a cell is you can tell the difference between a eukaryote and a prokaryote right the organalles are specialized differently when then look at the cell surface and the cell surface has different glycosylation patterns and these cells will stick together now lets go up a level in multicellular creatures you have cellular differentiation
285,lee cronin, now if you think about how embryos develop you go all the way back those cells undergo differentiation on a causal way thats biomechanically a feedback between the genetics and biomechanics i think we can use assembly theory to apply to tissue types we can even apply it to different cell disease types so thats what were doing next but we are trying to walk the thing is im trying to i want a leap ahead to go whoa we apply it to culture clearly you can apply it to memes and culture and weve also applied to assembly theory to cas and not as you think
286,lex fridman, cellular automaton by the way
287,lee cronin, yeah yeah cellular automaton not just as you think different ca rules were invented by different people at different times and one of my coworkers very talented chap basically was like oh i can realize that different people had different ideas with different rules and they copied each other and made slightly different cellular automaton rules and looked at them online and so he was able to refer an assembly index and copy number of rule whatever doing this thing but i digress
288,lee cronin, but it does show you can apply it at a higher scale so what do we need to do to apply assembly theory to things we need to agree theres a common set of building blocks so in a cell well in a multicellular creature you need to look back in time so there is the initial cell which the creature is fertilized and then starts to grow and then there is cell differentiation and you have to then make that causal chain both on those so that requires development of the organism in time or if you look at the cell surfaces and the cell types theyve got different features on the cell walls and inside the cell so were building up but obviously i want a leap to things like emoticons language mathematical theorems
289,lex fridman, but thats a very large number of steps to get from a molecule to the human brain
290,lee cronin, yeah and i think they are related but in hierarchies of emergence so you shouldnt compare them i mean the assembly index of a human brain what does that even mean well maybe we can look at the morphology of the human brain say all human brains have these number of features in common if they have those number and then lets look at a brain in a whale or a dolphin or a chimpanzee or a bird and say okay lets look at the assembly indices and number of features in these and now the copy number is just the number of how many birds are there how many chimpanzees are there how many humans are there
291,lex fridman, but then you have to discover for that the features that you would be looking for
292,lee cronin, yeah and that means you need to have some idea of the anatomy
293,lex fridman, but is there an automated way to discover features
294,lee cronin, i guess so and i think this is a good way to apply machine learning and image recognition just to basically characterize things
295,lex fridman, to apply compression to it to see what emerges and then use the features used as part of the compression as the measurement of as the thing that is searched for when youre measuring assembly index and copy number
296,lee cronin, and the compression has to be remember the assembly universe which is you have to go from assembly possible to assembly contingent and that jump from because assembly possible all possible brains all possible features all the time but we know that on the tree of life and also on the lineage of life going back to luca the human brain just didnt spring into existence yesterday its a long lineage of brains going all the way back and so if we could do assembly theory to understand the development not just in evolutionary history but in biological development as you grow we are going to learn something more
297,lex fridman, what would be amazing is if you can use assembly theory this framework to show the increase in the assembly index associated with i dont know cultures or pieces of text like language or images and so on and illustrate without knowing the data ahead of time just kind like you did with nasa that you were able to demonstrate that it applies in those other contexts i mean and that probably wouldnt at first and you have to evolve the theory somehow you have to change it you have to expand it
298,lee cronin, i think so
299,lex fridman, i guess this is as a paper a first step in saying okay can we create a general framework for measuring complexity of objects for measuring life the complexity of living organisms
300,lee cronin, yeah
301,lex fridman, thats what this is reaching for
302,lee cronin, that is the first step and also to say look we have a way of quantifying selection and evolution in a fairly not mundane but a fairly mechanical way because before now the ground truth for it was very subjective whereas here were talking about clean observables and theres going to be layers on that i mean with collaborators right now we already think we can do assembly theory on language and not only that wouldnt it be great if we can figure out how under pressure language is going to involve and be more efficient because youre going to want to transmit things
303,lee cronin, and again its not just about compression it is about understanding how you can make the most of the architecture youve already built and i think this is something beautiful that evolution does we are reusing those architectures we cant just abandon our evolutionary history and if you dont want to abandon your evolutionary history and you know that evolution has been happening then assembly theory works
304,lee cronin, and i think thats a key comment i want to make is that assembly theory is great for understanding when evolution has been used the next jump is when we go to technology because of course if you take the m processor i want to buy i havent bought one yet i cant justify it but i want it at some point the m processor arguably is theres quite a lot of features a quite large number the m came before it then the m all the way back you can apply assembly theory to microprocessor architecture it doesnt take a huge leap to see that
305,lex fridman, im a linux guy by the way so your examples go way over my head
306,lee cronin, yeah well whatever
307,lex fridman, is that a fruit company of some sort i dont even know yeah theres a lot of interesting stuff to ask about language like you could look at how would that work you could look at gpt gpt gpt    and try to analyze the kind of language it produces i mean thats almost trying to look at assembly index of intelligence systems
308,lee cronin, yeah i mean i think the thing about large language models and this is a whole hobbyhorse i have at the moment is that obviously theyre all about the evidence of evolution in the large language model comes from all the people that produced all the language and thats really interesting and all the corrections in the mechanical turk right
309,lex fridman, sure but thats part of the history part of the memory of the system
310,lee cronin, exactly so it would be really interesting to basically use an assembly based approach to making language in a hierarchy my guess is that we might be able to build a new type of large language model that uses assembly theory that it has more understanding of the past and how things were created basically the thing with llms is like everything everywhere all at once splat and make the user happy so theres not much intelligence in the model the model is how the human interacts with the model but wouldnt it be great if we could understand how to embed more intelligence in the system
311,lex fridman, what do you mean by intelligence there you seem to associate intelligence with history or memory
312,lee cronin, yeah i think selection produces intelligence
313,lex fridman, youre almost implying that selection is intelligence no
314,lee cronin, kind of i would go out in limb and say that but i think its a little bit more human beings have the ability to abstract and they can break beyond selection and this is darwinian selection because a human being doesnt have to basically do trial and error but they can think about it and say oh thats a bad idea wont do that and then technologies and so on
315,lex fridman, so we escaped darwinian evolution and now were onto some other kind of evolution i guess higher level
316,lee cronin, and assembly theory will measure that as well right because its all a lineage
317,lee cronin,kolmogorov complexity
318,lex fridman, okay another piece of criticism or by way of question is how is assembly theory or maybe assembly index different from kolmogorov complexity so for people who dont know a kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of a shortest computer program that produces the object as output
319,lee cronin, yeah there seems to be a disconnect between the computational approach so kolmogorov measure requires a turing machine requires a computer and thats one thing and the other thing is assembly theory is supposed to trace the process by which life evolution emerged right theres a main thing there there are lots of other layers
320,lee cronin, so kolmogorov complexity you can approximate kolmogorov complexity but its not really telling you very much about the actual its really telling you about your dataset compression of your dataset
321,lex fridman, sure
322,lee cronin, and so that doesnt really help you identify the turtle in this case is the computer and so what assembly theory does is im going to say its a trigger warning for anyone listening who loves complexity theory i think that were going to show that ait is a very important subset of assembly theory because heres what happens i think that assembly theory allows us to go understand when were selections occurring selection produces factories and things factories in the end produce computers and then algorithmic information theory comes out of that the frustration ive had with looking at life through this kind of information theory is it doesnt take into account causation so the main difference between assembly theory and all these complexity measures is theres no causal chain and i think thats the main
323,lex fridman, thats the causal chain is at the core of assembly theory
324,lee cronin, exactly and if youve got all your data in a computer memory all the datas the same you can access it in the same way you dont care you just compress it and you either look at the program runtime or the shortest program and that for me is absolutely not capturing what it is what selection does
325,lex fridman, but assembly theory looks at objects it doesnt have information about the object history its going to try to infer that history by looking for the shortest history right the object doesnt have a wikipedia page that goes with it about its history
326,lee cronin, i would say it does in a way and it is fascinating to look at so youve just got the object and you have no other information about the object what assembly theory allows you to do with just with the object is to and the word infer is correct i agree with infer you say well thats not the history but something really interesting comes from this
327,lee cronin, the shortest path is inferred from the object that is the worst case scenario if you have no machine to make it so that tells you about the depth of that object in time and so what assembly theory allows you to do is without considering any other circumstances to say from this object how deep is this object in time if we just treat the object as itself without any other constraints and thats super powerful because the shortest path then allows you to say oh this object wasnt just created randomly there was a process and so assembly theory is not meant to one up ait or to ignore the factory its just to say hey there was a factory and how big was that factory and how deep in time is it
328,lex fridman, but its still computationally very difficult to compute that history right for complex objects
329,lee cronin, it is it becomes harder but one of the thing thats super nice is that it constrains your initial conditions right
330,lex fridman, sure
331,lee cronin, it constrains where youre going to be so if you take say imagine so one of the things were doing right now is applying assembly theory to drug discovery now what everyones doing right now is taking all the proteins and looking at the proteins and looking at molecules doppler proteins why not instead look at the molecules that are involved in interacting with the receptors over time rather than thinking about and use the molecules evolve over time as a proxy for how the proteins evolved over time and then use that to constrain your drug discovery process
332,lee cronin, you flip the problem  and focus on the molecule evolution rather than the protein and so you can guess in the future what might happen so you rather than having to consider all possible molecules you know where to focus and thats the same thing if youre looking at in assembly spaces for an object where you dont know the entire history but you know that in the history of this object its not going to have some other motif there that it doesnt apply it doesnt appear in the past
333,lex fridman, but just even for the drug discovery point you made dont you have to simulate all of chemistry to figure out how to come up with constraints
334,lee cronin, no
335,lex fridman, and the molecules and the
336,lee cronin, no
337,lex fridman, i dont know enough about protein
338,lee cronin, well this is another thing that i think causes because this paper goes across so many boundaries so chemists have looked at this and said this is not correct reaction its like no its a graph
339,lex fridman, sure theres assembly index and shortest path examples here on chemistry
340,lee cronin, yeah and what you do is you look at the minimal constraints on that graph of course it has some mapping to the synthesis but actually you dont have to know all of chemistry you can build up the constraints space rather nicely but this is just at the beginning right there are so many directions this could go in and as i said it could all be wrong but hopefully its less wrong
341,lex fridman, what about the little criticism i saw of by way of question do you consider the different probabilities of each reaction in the chain so that there could be different when you look at a chain of events that led up to the creation of an object doesnt it matter that some parts in the chain are less likely than others
342,lee cronin, no
343,lex fridman, it doesnt matter
344,lee cronin, no no well lets go back so no not less likely but react so no so lets go back to what were looking at here so the assembly index is the minimal path that could have created that object probabilistically so imagine you have all your atoms in a plasma youve got enough energy theres collisions what is the quickest way you could zip out that molecule with no reaction constraints
345,lex fridman, how do you define quickest there then
346,lee cronin, its just basically walk on a random graph so we make an assumption that basically the timescale for forming the bonds so no i dont want to say that because then its going to have people getting obsessing about this point and your criticism is a really good one what were trying to say is this puts a lower bound on something of course some reactions are less possible than others but actually i dont think chemical reactions exist
347,lex fridman, oh boy what does that mean why dont chemical reactions exist
348,lee cronin, im writing a paper right now that i keep being told i have to finish and its called the origin of chemical reactions and it merely says that reactivity exists as controlled by the laws of quantum mechanics and reactions chemists put names on reactions so you can have i dont know the wittig reaction which is by wittig you could have the suzuki reaction which is by suzuki
349,lee cronin, now what are these reactions so these reactions are constrained by the following theyre constrained by the fact theyre on planet earth g  kelvin  bar so these are constraints theyre also constrained by the chemical composition of earth oxygen availability all this stuff and that then allows us to focus in our chemistry so when a chemist does a reaction thats a really nice compressed shorthand for constraint application glass flask pure reagent temperature pressure boom boom boom control control control control control
350,lee cronin, so of course we have bond energies so the bond energies are kind of intrinsic in a vacuum so the bond energy you have to have a bond and so for assembly theory to work you have to have a bond which means that bond has to give the molecule a half life so youre probably going to find later on that some bonds are weaker and that you are going to miss in mass spectrum when you look at the assembly of some molecules youre going to miscount the assembly of the molecule it falls apart too quickly because the bonds just form but you can solve that with looking at infrared
351,lee cronin, so when people think about the probability theyre kind of misunderstanding assembly theory says nothing about the chemistry because chemistry is chemistry and their constraints are put in by biology there was no chemist on the origin of life unless you believe in the chemist in the sky and its like santa claus they had a lot of work to do but chemical reactions do not exist and the constraints that allow chemical transformations to occur do exist
352,lex fridman, okay okay so its constraint so theres no chemical reactions its all constraint application which enables the emergence of whats a different word for chemical reaction
353,lee cronin, transformation
354,lex fridman, transformation
355,lee cronin, yeah like a function its a function but no but i love chemical reactions as a shorthand and so the chemists dont all go mad i mean of course chemical reactions exist on earth
356,lex fridman, its a shorthand
357,lee cronin, its a shorthand for these constraints
358,lex fridman, so assuming all these constraints that weve been using for so long that we just assume that thats what was the case in natural language conversation
359,lee cronin, exactly the grammar of chemistry of course emerges in reactions and we can use them reliably but i do not think the wittig reaction is accessible on venus
360,lex fridman, right and this is useful to remember to frame it as constraint application is useful for when you zoom out to the bigger picture of the universe and looking at the chemistry of the universe and then starting to apply assembly theory thats interesting thats really interesting but weve also pissed off the chemists now
361,lee cronin, oh theyre pretty happy but well most of them
362,lex fridman, no everybody deep down is happy i think theyre just sometimes feisty thats how they have fun
363,lee cronin, everyone is grumpy on some days when you challenge the problem with this paper is its almost like i went to a park its like i used to do this occasionally when i was young go to a meeting and just find a way to offend everyone at the meeting simultaneously even the factions that dont like each other theyre all unified in the hatred of you just offending them this paper it feels like the person that went to the party and offended everyone simultaneously so stop fighting with themselves and just focused on this paper
364,lee cronin,nature review process
365,lex fridman, maybe just a little insider interesting information what were the editors of nature what the reviews and so on how difficult was that process because this is a pretty big paper
366,lee cronin, so when we originally sent the paper we sent the paper and the editor said that this is quite a long process we sent the paper and the editor gave us some feedback and said i dont think its that interesting or its hard its hard concept and the editor gave us some feedback and sarah and i took a year to rewrite the paper
367,lex fridman, was the nature of the feedback very specific on this part this part or was it like what are you guys smoking what kind of crack are you taking
368,lee cronin, yeah it was kind of the latter what are you smoking
369,lex fridman, okay but polite and theres promise
370,lee cronin, yeah well the thing is the editor was really critical but in a really professional way and i mean for me this was the way science should happen so when it came back we had too many equations in the paper if you look at the preprint theres just equations everywhere like  equations and when i said to abhishek who was the first author weve got to remove all the equations but my assembly equations staying in abhishek was like no we cant
371,lee cronin, i said well look if we want to explain this to people theres a real challenge and so sarah and i went through the i think it was actually  versions of the paper but basically we got to version  or something we said right zero it start again so we wrote the whole paper again we knew the entire
372,lex fridman, amazing
373,lee cronin, and we just went bit by bit by bit and said what is it we want to say and then we sent the paper in and we expected it to be rejected and not even go to review and then we got notification back it had gone to review and we were like oh my god its so going to get rejected hows it going to get rejected because the first assembly paper on the mass spec we sent to nature went through six rounds of review and rejected and by a chemist that just said i dont believe you you must be committing fraud
374,lee cronin, and long story probably a boring story but in this case it went out to review the comments came back and the comments were incredibly they were very deep comments from all the reviewers but the nice thing was the reviewers were kind of very critical but not dismissive they were like oh really explain this explain this explain this explain this
375,lex fridman, thats great
376,lee cronin, are you sure its not kolmogorov are you sure its not this and we went through i think three rounds of review pretty quick and the editor went yeah its in
377,lex fridman, but maybe you could just comment on the whole process youve published some pretty huge papers on all kinds of topics within chemistry and beyond some of them have some little spice in them a little spice of crazy like tom waits says i like my tom with a little drop of poison its not a mundane paper so whats it like psychologically to go through all this process to keep getting rejected to get reviews from people that dont get the paper or all that kind of stuff just from a question of a scientist what is that like
378,lee cronin, i mean this paper for me kind of because this wasnt the first time we tried to publish assembly theory at the highest level the nature communications paper on the mass spec the idea went to nature and got rejected went through six rounds of review and got rejected and i just was so confused when the chemist said this cant be possible i do not believe you can measure complexity using mass spec and also by the way complex molecules can randomly form and were like but look at the data the data says and they said no no we dont believe you and we went and i just wouldnt give up and the editor in the end was just like different editors actually right
379,lex fridman, whats behind that never giving up when youre sitting there  oclock in the evening theres a melancholy feeling that comes over you and youre like okay this is rejection number five or its not rejection but maybe it feels like a rejection because the comments are that you totally dont get it what gives you strength to keep going there
380,lee cronin, i dont know i dont normally get emotional about papers but it is not about giving up because we want to get it published because we want the glory or anything its just like why dont you understand and so what i would just is try to be as rational as possible and say yeah you didnt like it tell me why and then
381,lee cronin, sorry give me a second silly never get emotional about papers normally but i think what we do you just compressed five years of angst from this
382,lex fridman, so its been rough
383,lee cronin, its not just rough its like it happened i came up with the assembly equation remote from sarah in arizona and the people at sfi i felt like i was a mad person the guy depicted in a beautiful mind who was just like not the actual genius part but just the gibberish gibberish gibberish
384,lex fridman, just the crazy part
385,lee cronin, because i kept writing expanded and i have no mathematical ability at all and i was making these mathematical expansions where i kept seeing the same motif again i was like i think this is a copy number the same string is coming again and again and again i couldnt do the math and then i realized the copy number fell out of the equation and everything collapsed down i was like oh that works kind of
386,lee cronin, so we submitted the paper and then when it was almost accepted the mass spec one and it was astrobiologists said great a mass spectroscopist said great and the chemist went nonsense biggest pile of nonsense ever fraud and i was like but why fraud and they just said just because i was like well i could not convince the editor in this case the editor was just so pissed off they see it as a youre wasting my time and i would not give up i wrote i went and dissected all the parts and i think although i mean i got upset about it was kind of embarrassing actually but i guess
387,lex fridman, i bet it was beautiful
388,lee cronin, but it was just trying to understand why they didnt like it so part of me was really devastated and a part of me was super excited because im like huh they cant tell me why im wrong and this kind of goes back to when i was at school i was in a kind of learning difficulties class and i kept going to the teacher and saying what do i do today to prove im smart and they were like nothing you cant i was like give me a job give me something to do give me a job to do something to do and i kind of felt like that a bit when i was arguing with the and not arguing there was no ad hominem i wasnt telling the editor they were idiots or anything like this or the reviewers i kept it strictly factual
389,lee cronin, and all i did is i just kept knocking it down bit by bit by bit by bit by bit it was ultimately rejected and it got published elsewhere and then the actual experimental data so in this paper the experimental justification was already published so when we did this one and we went through the versions and then we sent it in and in the end it just got accepted we were like well thats kind of cool right this is kind of like some days
390,lee cronin, sorry the first author was like i cant believe it got accepted i was like nor am i but its great its good and then when the paper was published i was not expecting the backlash i was expecting computational well no actually i was just expecting one person whod been trolling me for a while about it just to carry on trolling but i didnt expect the backlash and then i wrote to the editor and apologized and the editor was like what are you apologizing for it was a great paper of course its going to get backlash you said some controversial stuff but its awesome
391,lex fridman, well i think its a beautiful story of perseverance and the backlash is just a negative word for discourse which i think is beautiful thats the science
392,lee cronin, i think as i said when it got accepted and people were saying were kind of hacking on it and i was like papers are not gold medals the reason i wanted to publish that paper in nature is because it says hey theres something before biological evolution you have to have that if youre not a creationist by the way this is an approach first time someone has put a concrete mechanism or sorry a concrete quantification and what comes next you are pushing on is a mechanism and thats what we need to get to is an auto catalytic sets selfreplicating molecules some other features that come in
393,lee cronin, and the fact that this paper has been so discussed for me is a dream come true it doesnt get better than that if you cant accept a few people hating it and the nice thing is the thing that really makes me happy is that no one has attacked the actual physical content
394,lee cronin, you can measure the assembly index you can measure selection now so either thats right or its well either thats helpful or unhelpful if its unhelpful this paper will sink down and no one will use it again if its helpful itll help people scaffold on it and well start to converge for a new paradigm so i think that thats the thing that i wanted to see my colleagues authors collaborators and people were like youve just published this paper youre a chemist why have you done this who are you to be doing evolutionary theory well i dont know i mean sorry did i need to
395,lex fridman, who is anyone to do anything well im glad you did let me just before coming back to origin of life and these kinds of questions you mentioned learning difficulties i didnt know about this so what was it like
396,lee cronin, i wasnt very good at school right
397,lee cronin, i wasnt very good at school right
398,lex fridman, this is when you were very young
399,lee cronin, yeah but in primary school my handwriting was really poor and apparently i couldnt read and my mathematics was very poor so they just said this is a problem they identified it my parents at the time were confused because i was busy taking things apart buying electronic junk from the shop trying to build computers and things and then once i got out of when i think about the major transition in my stupidity everyone thought i wasnt that stupid when i was basically everyone thought i was faking i liked stuff and i was faking wanting to be it so i always want to be a scientist so five six seven years old id be a scientist take things apart and everyones like yeah this guy wants to be a scientist but hes an idiot so everyone was really confused i think at first that i wasnt smarter than i was claiming to be
400,lee cronin, and then i just basically didnt do well in any of the tests and i went down and down and down and down and then i was like huh this is really embarrassing i really like maths and everyone says i cant do it i really like physics and chemistry and science and people say you cant read and write and so i found myself in a learning difficulties class at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school in the uk secondary school is   years old and i remember being put in the remedial class and the remedial class was basically full of three types of people there were people quite violent and there were people who couldnt speak english and there were people that really had learning difficulties so the one thing i can objectively remember was i could read i liked reading i read a lot but something in me im a bit of a rebel i refused to read what i was told to read and i found it difficult to read individual words in the way they were told
401,lee cronin, but anyway i got caught one day teaching someone else to read and they said okay we dont understand this id always known i wanted to be a scientist but i didnt really know what that meant and i realized you had to go to university and i thought i can just go to university they take curious people no no no need to have these you have to be able to enter these exams to get this grade point average and the fact is the exams youve been entered into you are just going to get c d or e you cant even get a b or c these are the uk gcses i was like  oh shit and i said can you just put me into the higher exams they said no no youre going to fail theres no chance so my father intervened and said just let him go in the exams and they said hes definitely going to fail its a waste of time waste of money and he said what if we paid so they said okay so you didnt actually have to pay you only had to pay if i failed
402,lee cronin, so i took the exams and passed them fortunately i didnt get the top grades but i got into a levels but then that also limited what i could do at a levels i wasnt allowed to do a level maths
403,lex fridman, what do you mean you werent allowed to
404,lee cronin, because i had such a bad math grade from my gcse i only had a c but they wouldnt let me go into the abc for maths because of some coursework requirement back then so the top grade i could have got was a c so c d or e so i got a c and they let me do as level maths which is this half intermediate and get to go to university but i liked chemistry i had a good chemistry teacher so in the end i got to university to do chemistry
405,lex fridman, so through that process i think for kids in that situation its easy to start believing that youre not how do i put it that youre stupid and basically give up that youre just not good at math youre not good at school so this is by way of advice for people for interesting people for interesting young kids right now experiencing the same thing where was the place what was the source of you not giving up there
406,lee cronin, i have no idea other than i really liked not understanding stuff for me when i not understand something i feel like i dont understand anything but now but back then i remember when i was like i dont know i tried to build a laser when i was eight and i thought how hard could it be and basically i was going to build a co laser and i was like right i think i need some partially coated mirrors i need some carbon dioxide and i need a high voltage and i was so stupid i was so embarrassed t make enough co i actually set a fire and tried to filter the flame
407,lex fridman, oh nice thats an idea
408,lee cronin, just to collect enough co and it completely failed and i burnt half the garage down so my parents were not very happy about that so that was one thing i really liked first principle thinking so i remember being super curious and being determined to find answers and so when people do give advice about this why ask for advice about this i dont really have that much advice other than dont give up and one of the things i try to do as a chemistry professor in my group is i hire people that i think if theyre persistent enough who am i to deny them the chance because people gave me a chance and i was able to do stuff
409,lex fridman, do you believe in yourself essentially
410,lee cronin, so i love being around smart people and i love confusing smart people and when im confusing smart people not by stealing their wallets and hiding it somewhere but if i can confuse smart people that is the one piece of hope that i might be doing something interesting
411,lex fridman, wow thats quite brilliant as a gradient to optimize hang out with smart people and confuse them and the more confusing it is the more theres something there
412,lee cronin, and as long as theyre not telling you just a complete idiot and they give you different reasons and everyone because with assembly theory and people said oh its wrong and i was like why and no one could give me a consistent reason they said oh because its been done before or its just inaudible  or its just there that and the other so i think the thing that i like to do is and in academia its hard because people are critical but the criticism although i got upset about it earlier which is silly but not silly because obviously its hard work being on your own or with a team spatially separated during lockdown and try to keep everyone on board and have some faith i always wanted to have a new idea and so i like a new idea and i want to nurture it as long as possible and if someone can give me actionable criticism thats why i think i was trying to say earlier when i was stuck for words give me actionable criticism
413,lee cronin, its wrong okay why is it wrong say oh your equations incorrect for this or your method is wrong so what i try and do is get enough criticism from people to then triangulate and go back and ive been very fortunate in my life that ive got great colleagues great collaborators funders mentors and people that will take the time to say you are wrong because and then what i have to do is integrate the wrongness and go oh cool maybe i can fix that and i think criticism is really good people have a go at me because im really critical but im not criticizing you as a person im just criticizing the idea and trying to make it better and say what about this
414,lee cronin, and sometimes my filters are truncated in some ways im just like thats wrong thats wrong thats wrong whyd you do this and people are like oh my god you just told me you destroyed my lifes work im like relax no im just like lets make it better and i think that we dont do that enough because we are either personally critical which isnt helpful or we dont give any criticism at all because were too scared
415,lex fridman, yeah ive seen you be pretty aggressively critical but every time ive seen its the idea not the person
416,lex fridman,time and free will
417,lee cronin, im sure i make mistakes on thati argue lots with sara and shes shocked ive argued with joscha joscha bach in the past and he is like youre just making that up and im like no not quite but kind of but i had a big argument with sara about time and shes like no time doesnt exist im like no no time does exist and as she realized that her conception of assembly theory and my conception of assembly theory was the same thing necessitated us to abandon the fact that time is eternal to actually really fundamentally question how the universe produces combinatorial novelty
418,lex fridman, so time is fundamental for assembly theory im just trying to figure out where you and sara converged
419,lee cronin, i think assembly theory is fine in this time right now but i think it helps us understand that something interesting is going on ive been really inspired by a guy called nick gisin im going to butcher his argument but i love his argument a lot so i hope he forgives me if he hears about it but basically if you want free will time has to be fundamental and if you want time to be fundamental you have to give up on platonic mathematics and you have to use intuition by the way and again im going to butcher this but basically hilbert said that infinite numbers are allowed and i think it was brouwer who said no you cant all numbers are finite so lets go back a step because it was like people going to say assembly theory seems to explain that large combinatorial space allows you to produce things like life and technology and that large combinatorial space is so big its not even accessible to a sean carroll david deutsch multiverse that physicists saying that all of the universe already exists in time is probably provably thats a strong word not correct
420,lee cronin, that we are going to know that the universe as it stands the present the way the present builds the future is so big the universe cant ever contain the future and this is a really interesting thing i think max tegmark has this mathematical universe he says the universe is like a block universe and i apologize to max if im getting it wrong but people think you can just move you have the stat you have the initial conditions and you can run the universe right to the end and go backwards and forwards in that universe that is not correct
421,lex fridman, let me load that in the universe is not big enough to contain the future
422,lee cronin, yeah thats why thats it
423,lex fridman, thats a beautiful way of saying that time is fundamental
424,lee cronin, yes and this is why the law of the excluded middle something is true or false only works in the past is it going to snow in new york next week or in austin you might in austin say probably not in new york you might say yeah if you go forward to next week and say did it snow in new york last week true or false you can answer that question the fact that the law of the excluded middle cannot apply to the future explains why time is fundamental
425,lex fridman, thats a good example intuitive example but its possible that we might be able to predict whether its going to snow if we had the perfect information
426,lee cronin, i think
427,lex fridman, youre saying it not
428,lee cronin, impossible impossible so heres why ill make a really quick argument and this argument isnt mine its nicks and a few other people
429,lex fridman, can you explain his view on time being fundamental
430,lee cronin, yeah so ill give my view which resonates with his but basically its very simple actually it would say your ability to design and do an experiment is exercising free will so he used that thought process i never really thought about it that way and that you actively make decisions i used to think that free will was a consequence of just selection but im understanding that human free will is something really interesting and he very much inspired me but i think that what sara walker said that inspired me as well these will converge is that i think that the universe and the universe is very big huge but actually the place that is largest in the universe right now the largest place in the universe is earth
431,lex fridman, yeah ive seen you say that and boy does that thats an interesting one to process what do you mean by that earth is the biggest place in the universe
432,lee cronin, because we have this combinatorial scaffolding going all the way back from luca so youve got cells that can selfreplicate and then you go all the way to terraforming the earth youve got all these architectures the amount of selection thats going on biological selection just to be clear biological evolution and then have multicellularity then animals and abstraction and with abstraction there was another kick because you can then build architectures and computers and cultures and language and these things are the biggest things that exist in the universe because we can just build architectures that could naturally arise anywhere and the further that distance goes in time and its gigantic
433,lex fridman, from a complexity perspective
434,lee cronin, yeah
435,lex fridman, okay wait a minute but i know youre being poetic but how do you know theres not other earthlike how do you know youre basically saying earth is really special its awesome stuff as far as we look out theres nothing like it going on but how do you know theres not nearly infinite number of places where cool stuff like this is going on
436,lee cronin, i agree and i would say ill say again that earth is the most gigantic thing we know in the universe combinatorially we know
437,lex fridman, we know yeah
438,lex fridman,communication with aliens
439,lee cronin, now i guess this is just purely a guess i have no data other than hope maybe not hope maybe no i have some data that every star in the sky probably has planets and life is probably emerging on these planets but the amount of contingency that is associated with life is i think the combinatorial space associated with these planets is so different our causal cones are never going to overlap or not easily and this is the thing that makes me sad about alien life its why we have to create alien life in the lab as quickly as possible because i dont know if we are going to be able to be able to build architectures that will intersect with alien intelligence architectures
440,lex fridman, intersect you dont mean in time or space
441,lee cronin, time and the ability to communicate
442,lex fridman, the ability to communicate
443,lee cronin, yeah my biggest fear in a way is that life is everywhere but we become infinitely more lonely because of our scaffolding in that combinatorial space because its so big
444,lex fridman, so youre saying the constraints created by the environment that led to the factory of darwinian evolution are just this little tiny cone in a nearly infinite combinatorial space
445,lee cronin, exactly
446,lex fridman, so theres other cones like it why cant we communicate with other just because we cant create it doesnt mean we cant appreciate the creation right sorry detect the creation
447,lee cronin, i truly dont know but its an excuse for me to ask for people to give me money to make a planet simulator
448,lex fridman, yeah right
449,lee cronin, if i can make
450,lex fridman, with a different crosstalk 
451,lee cronin, its like another shameless say its like give me money i need money
452,lex fridman, this was all long plug for a planet simulator hey i wont be the first in line to do that
453,lee cronin, my rick garage has run out of room
454,lex fridman, yeah
455,lee cronin, no
456,lex fridman, and this planet simulator you mean a different planet or different sets of environments and pressures
457,lee cronin, exactly if we could basically recreate the selection before biology as we know it that gives rise to a different biology we should be able to put the constraints on where to look in the universe so heres the thing heres my dream my dream is that by creating life in the lab based upon constraints we understand lets go for venus type life or earth type life or something again do an earth  screw it lets do an earth  an earth  has a different genetic alphabet fine thats fine different protein alphabet fine have cells and evolution all that stuff we will then be able to say okay life is a more general phenomena selection is more general than what we think is the chemical constraints on life and we can point at james webb and other telescopes at other planets that we are in that zone we are most likely to combinatorially overlap with because so theres chemistry
458,lex fridman, youre looking for some overlap
459,lee cronin, and then we can then basically shine light on them literally and look at light coming back and apply advanced assembly theory to general theory of language that well get and say huh in that signal it looks random but theres a copy number oh this random set of things that shouldnt be that looks like a true random number generator has structure as not inaudible  an it type structure but evolutionary structure given by assembly theory and we start to but i would say that because im a shameless assembly theorist
460,lex fridman, yeah it just feels like the cone i might be misusing the word cone here but the width of the cone is growing faster is growing really fast to where eventually all the cones overlap even in a very very very large combinatorial space but then again if youre saying the universe is also growing very quickly in terms of possibilities
461,lee cronin, i hope that as we build abstractions one idea is that as we go to intelligence intelligence allows us to look at the regularities around us in the universe and that gives us some common grounding to discuss with aliens and you might be right that we will overlap there even though we have completely different chemistry literally completely different chemistry that we will be able to pass information from one another but its not a given and i have to try and divorce hope and emotion away from what i can logically justify
462,lex fridman, but its just hard to intuit a world a universe where theres nearly infinite complexity objects and they somehow cant detect each other
463,lee cronin, the universe is expanding but the nice thing is i would say i would look you see i think carl sagan did the wrong thing not the wrong thing he flicked the voyager program and the pale blue dot and said look how big the universe is i wouldve done it the other way around and said look at the voyager probe that came from the planet earth that came from luca look at how big earth is
464,lex fridman, then it produced that
465,lee cronin, it produced that
466,lex fridman, yeah
467,lee cronin, and that i think is completely amazing and then that should allow people on earth to think about probably we should try and get causal chains off earth onto mars onto the moon wherever whether its human life or martian life that we create it doesnt matter but i think this combinatorial space tells us something very important about the universe and that i realized in assembly theory that the universe is too big to contain itself now coming back i want to change your mind about time because im guessing that your time is just a coordinate so im going to change
468,lex fridman, im guessing youre one of those
469,lee cronin, one of those im change my mind in real time or at least attempt
470,lex fridman, oh in real time there you go i already got the tattoo so this is going to be embarrassing if you change my mind
471,lee cronin, but you can just add an arrow of time onto it right
472,lex fridman, yeah true just modify it
473,lee cronin, or raise it a bit and the argument that i think that is really most interesting is people say the initial conditions specify the future of the universe okay fine lets say thats the case for a moment now lets go back to newtonian mechanics now the uncertainty principle in newtonian mechanics is this if i give you the coordinates of an object moving in space and the coordinates of another object and they collide in space and those initial conditions you should know exactly whats going to happen however you cannot specify these coordinates to infinite precision now everyone says oh this is like the chaos theory argument no no its deeper than that heres a problem with numbers this is where hilbert and brouwer fell out to have the coordinates of this object a given object thats colliding you have to have them to infinite precision thats what hilbert says theres no problem infinite precision is fine lets just take that for granted
474,lee cronin, but when the object is finite and it cant store its own coordinates what do you do so in principle if a finite object cannot be specified to infinite precision in principle the initial conditions dont apply
475,lex fridman, how do you know it cant store its
476,lee cronin, how do you store an in long number in a finite size
477,lex fridman, were using infinity very loosely here
478,lee cronin, no no were using
479,lex fridman, infinite precision not loosely but
480,lee cronin, very precisely
481,lex fridman, so you think infinite precision is required
482,lee cronin, lets take the object lets say the object is a golf ball a golf ball is a few centimeters in diameter we can work out how many atoms are in the golf ball and lets say we can store numbers down to atomic dislocations so we can work out how many atoms there are in the golf ball and we can store the coordinates in that golf ball down to that number but beyond that we cant lets make the golf ball smaller and this is where i think that we think that we get randomness in quantum mechanics and some people say you cant get randomness quantum mechanics deterministic but aha this is where we realize that classical mechanics and quantum mechanics suffer from the same uncertainty principle and that is the inability to specify the initial conditions to a precise enough degree to give you determinism
483,lee cronin, the universe is intrinsically too big and thats why time exists its nondeterministic looking back into the past you can use logical arguments because you can say was it true or false you already know but this is the fact we are unable to predict the future with the precision is not evidence of lack of knowledge its evidence the universe is generating new things
484,lex fridman, okay first of all quantum mechanics you could just say statistically whats going to happen when two golf balls hit each other
485,lee cronin, statistically but sure i can say statistically whats going to happen but then when they do happen and then you keep nesting it together it goes almost back to look lets think about entropy in the universe so how do we understand entropy change or process we can use the ergodic hypothesis we can also have have the counterfactuals where we have all the different states and we can even put that in the multiverse but both those theyre nonphysical the multiverse collapses back to the same problem about the precision so if you accept you dont have to have true and false going forward into the future the real numbers are real theyre observables
486,lex fridman, were trying to see exactly where time being fundamental sneaks in and this difference between the golf ball cant contain its own position perfectly precisely how that leads to time needing to be fundamental
487,lee cronin, do you believe or do you accept you have free will
488,lex fridman, yeah i think at this moment in time i believe that i have free will
489,lee cronin, so then you have to believe that time is fundamental
490,lex fridman, i understand thats a statement youve made
491,lee cronin, no that we can logically follow because if you dont have free will so if youre in a universe that has no time universe is deterministic if its deterministic then you have no free will
492,lex fridman, i think the space of how much we dont know is so vast that saying the universe is deterministic and from that jumping into theres no free will is just too difficult of a leap
493,lee cronin, no i logically follow no no i dont disagree its deep and its important all im saying and its actually different to what ive said before is that if you dont require platonistic mathematics and accepts that nondeterminism is how the universe looks and that gives us our creativity and the way the universe is getting novelty its really deeply important in assembly theory because assembly theory starts to actually give you a mechanism where you go from boring time which is basically initial conditions specify everything to a mismatch in creative time and i hope well do experiments i would love to do an experiment that prove that time is fundamental and the universe is generating novelty i dont know all the features of that experiment yet but by having these conversations openly and getting people to think about the problems in a new way better people more intelligent people with good mathematical backgrounds can say oh hey ive got an idea i would love to do an experiment that shows that the universe is too big for itself going forward in time
494,lee cronin, and this is why i really hate the idea of the boltzmann brain the boltzmann brain makes me super like everyones having a free lunch its like saying lets break all the laws of physics so a boltzmann brain is this idea that in a long enough universe a brain will just emerge in the universe as conscious and that neglects the causal chain of evolution that required to produce that brain and this is where the computational argument really falls down because a computationalist could say i can calculate probability of a boltzmann brain and theyll give you a probability but i can calculate probability of a boltzmann brain zero
495,lex fridman, just because the space of possibilities is so large
496,lee cronin, yeah when we start falling ourselves with numbers that we cant actually measure and we cant ever conceive of i think it doesnt give us a good explanation and i want to explain why life is in the universe i think life is actually novelty minor life basically mines novelty almost from the future and actualizes in the present
497,lex fridman, okay life is a novelty minor from the future that is actualized in the present
498,lee cronin, yep i think so
499,lex fridman, novelty minor first of all novelty whats the origin of novelty when you go from boring time to creative time where is that is it as simple as randomness like youre referring to
500,lee cronin, i am really struggling with randomness because i had a really good argument with joscha bach about randomness and he just said randomness doesnt give you free will thats insane because youd just be random and i think hes right at that level but i dont think he is right on another level and its not about randomness its about constrained im making this up as i go along so making this up constrained opportunity so the novelty what is novelty this is what i think is a funny thing if you ever want to discuss ai why i think everyones gone ai mad is that theyre misunderstanding novelty but lets think about novelty yes what is novelty so i think novelty is a genuinely new configuration that is not predicted by the past and that you discover in the present and that is truly different now everyone says that some people say that novelty doesnt exist its always with precedent i want to do experiments that show that that is not the case and it goes back to a question you asked me a few moments ago which is where is the factory
501,lee cronin, because i think the same mechanism that gives us a factory gives us novelty and i think that is why im so deeply hung up on time of course im wrong but how wrong and i think that life opens up that combinatorial space in a way that our current laws of physics although as contrived in a deterministic initial condition universe even with the get out of the multiverse david deutsch style which i love by the way but i dont think is correct but its really beautiful
502,lex fridman, multiverse
503,lee cronin, david deutsches conception of the multiverse is given but i think that the problem with wave particle duality in quantum mechanics is not about the multiverse its about understanding how determined the past is i dont just think that actually this is a discussion i was having with sara about that where she was like oh i think weve been debating this for a long time now about how do we reconcile novelty determinism in determinism
504,lex fridman, okay just to clarify both you and sara think the universe is not deterministic
505,lee cronin, i wont speak for sara but roughly i think the universe is deterministic looking back in the past but undetermined going forward in the future so im having my cake and eating it here this is because i fundamentally dont understand randomness as joscha told me or other people told me but if i adopt a new view now which the new view is the universe is just nondeterministic but id like to refine that and say the universe appears deterministic going back in the past but its undetermined going forward in the future so how can we have a universe that has deterministically looking rules thats nondetermined
506,lee cronin,  universe that has deterministicallylooking rules that is nondetermined going into the future its this breakdown in precision in the initial conditions and we have to just stop using initial conditions and start looking at trajectories and how the combinatorial space behaves in an expanding universe in time and space and assembly theory helps us quantify the transition to biology and biology appears to be noveltymining because its making crazy stuff that are unique to earth right there are objects on earth that are unique to earth that will not be found anywhere else because you can do the combinatorial math
507,lex fridman, what was that statement you made about life is noveltymining from the future whats the little element of time that youre introducing there
508,lee cronin, what im kind of meaning is because the future is bigger than the present in a deterministic universe how do the states go from one to another theres a mismatch right
509,lex fridman, yeah
510,lee cronin, so that must mean that you have a little bit of indeterminism whether thats randomness or something else i dont understand i want to do experiments to formulate a theory to refine that as we go forward that might help us explain that and i think thats why im so determined to try and crack the nonlife to life transition looking at networks and molecules and that might help us think about the mechanism but certainly the future is bigger than the past in my conception of the universe and some conception of the universe and
511,lex fridman, by the way thats not obvious right the future being bigger than the past well thats one statement and the statement that the universe is not big enough to contain the future is another statement that one is a big one that ones a really big one
512,lee cronin, i think so but i think its entirely  because look we have the second law and right now we dont need the second law if the futures bigger than the past it follows naturally so why are we retrofitting all these sticking plasters onto our reality to hold onto a timeless universe
513,lex fridman, yeah but thats because its kind of difficult to imagine the universe that cant contain the future
514,lee cronin, but isnt that really exciting
515,lex fridman, its very exciting but its hard we are humans on earth and we have a very kind of fourdimensional conception of the world of d plus time its just hard to intuit a world where what does that even mean a universe that cant contain the future
516,lee cronin, yeah its kind of crazy but obvious
517,lex fridman, its weird its weird i suppose it sounds obvious yeah if its true
518,lee cronin, so the reason why assembly theory turned me onto that was that lets just start in the present and look at all the complex molecules and go backwards in time and understand how evolutionary processes gave rise to them its not at all obvious that taxol which is one of the most complex natural products produced by biology was going to be invented by biology its an accident
519,lee cronin, taxol is unique to earth theres no taxol elsewhere in the universe and taxol was not decided by the initial conditions it was decided by this interplay between the  so the past simply is embedded in the present it gives some features but why the past doesnt map to the future onetoone is because the universe is too big to contain itself that gives space for creativity and novelty and some things which are unpredictable
520,lee cronin,cellular automata
521,lex fridman, well okay so given that youre disrespecting the power of the initial conditions let me ask you about how do you explain that cellular automata are able to produce such incredible complexity given just basic rules and basic initial conditions
522,lee cronin, i think that this falls into the brouwerhilbert trap so how do you get cellular automata to produce complexity you have a computer you generate a display and you map the change of that in time there are some cas that repeat like functions
523,lee cronin, its fascinating to me that for pi there is a formula where you can go to the millionth decimal place of pi and read out the number without having to go there but there are some numbers where you cant do that and you have to just crank through whether its wolframian computational irreducibility or some other thing well it doesnt matter but these cas that complexity is that just complexity or a number that is basically youre mining that number in time is that just a display screen for that number that function
524,lex fridman, well cant you say the same thing about the complexity on earth then
525,lee cronin, no because the complexity on earth has a copy number and an assembly index associated with it that ca is just a number running
526,lex fridman, you dont think it has a copy number wait a minute 
527,lee cronin, well it does where were looking at humans producing different rules but then its nested on selection so those cas are produced by selection the ca is such a fascinating pseudocomplexity generator what i would love to do is understand quantify the degree of surprise in a ca and run it long enough but what i guess that means is we have to instantiate we have to have a number of experiments where were generating different rules and running them time steps but  oh i got it
528,lee cronin, cas are mining novelty in the future by iteration right and youre like  oh thats great thats great you didnt predict it some rules you can predict whats going to happen and other rules you cant so for me if anything cas are evidence that the universe is too big to contain itself because otherwise youd know what the rules are going to do forevermore
529,lex fridman, right i guess you were saying that the physicist saying that all you need is the initial conditions and the rules of physics is somehow missing the bigger picture
530,lee cronin, yeah
531,lex fridman, and if you look at cas all you need is the initial condition and the rules and then run the thing
532,lee cronin, you need three things you need the initial conditions you need the rules and you need time iteration to mine it out without the coordinate you cant get it out
533,lex fridman, sure and that to you is fundamental
534,lee cronin, and you cant predict it from the initial conditions if you could then it could be fine
535,lex fridman, and that time is
536,lee cronin, a resource
537,lex fridman,  like the foundation of the history the memory of each of the things it created it has to have that memory of all the things that led up to it
538,lee cronin, yeah you have to have the resource because time is a fundamental resource yeah i think i had a major epiphany about randomness but i keep doing that every two days and then it goes away again its random
539,lex fridman, youre a time fundamentalist
540,lee cronin, and you should be as well if you believe in free will then the only conclusion is that time is fundamental otherwise you cannot have free will it logically follows
541,lex fridman, well the foundation of my belief in free will is observationdriven
542,lee cronin, but thats
543,lex fridman, i think if you use logic logically it seems like the universe is deterministic
544,lee cronin, looking backwards in time then thats correct the universe is
545,lex fridman, and then everything else is a kind of leap it requires a leap
546,lee cronin, this is why i think machine learning is going to provide a chunk of that right to help us explain this so the way id say it if you take 
547,lex fridman, thats interesting why
548,lex fridman,agi
549,lee cronin, well my favorite one is  because ai doomers are driving me mad and in fact we dont have any intelligence yet i call ai autonomous informatics just to make people grumpy
550,lex fridman, yeah youre saying were quite far away from agi
551,lee cronin, i think that we have no conception of intelligence and i think that we dont understand how the human brain does what it does i think that neuroscience is making great advances but i think that we have no idea about agi so i am a technological i guess optimist i believe we should do everything the whole regulation of ai is nonsensical why would you regulate excel other than the fact that clippy should come back and i love excel  because we can do the flight simulator
552,lex fridman, sorry in excel
553,lee cronin, yeah have you not played the flight simulator in
554,lex fridman, in excel 
555,lee cronin, yeah
556,lex fridman, what does that look like
557,lee cronin, its like wireframe very basic but basically i think its x zero y zero shift and it opens up and you can play the flight simulator
558,lex fridman, oh wow wait wait is it using excel
559,lee cronin, excel 
560,lex fridman, okay
561,lee cronin, i resurrected it the other day and saw clippy again for the first time in a long time
562,lex fridman, well clippy is definitely coming back but youre saying we dont have a great understanding of what is intelligence what is the intelligence underpinning the human mind
563,lee cronin, im very frustrated by the way that were ai dooming right now and people are bestowing some kind of magic now lets go back a bit so you said about agi are we far away from agi yes i do not think were going to get to agi anytime soon ive seen no evidence of it and the ai doom scenario is nonsensical in the extreme
564,lee cronin, the reason why i think its nonsensical  and i dont think there isnt things we should do and be very worried about there are things we need to worry about right now what ai are doing whether its fake data fake users i want authentic people authentic data i dont want everything to be faked and i think its a really big problem and i absolutely want to go on the record to say i really worry about that what im not worried about is that some fictitious entity is going to turn us all to paperclips or detonate nuclear bombs or maybe i dont know anything you can think of
565,lee cronin, why is this ill take a very simple series of logical arguments and the ai doomers do not have the correct epistemology they do not understand what knowledge is and until we understand what knowledge is theyre not going to get anywhere because theyre applying things falsely so let me give you a very simple argument
566,lee cronin, people talk about the probability pdoom of ai we can work out the probability of an asteroid hitting the planet why because its happened before we know the mechanism we know that theres a gravity well or that spacetime is bent and stuff falls in we dont know the probability of agi because we have no mechanism so let me give you another one which is like im really worried about ag whats ag ag is antigravity one day we could wake up and antigravity is discovered were all going to die the atmosphere is going to float away were going to float away were all doomed
567,lee cronin, what is the probability of ag we dont know because theres no mechanism for ag do we worry about it no and i dont understand the current reason for certain people in certain areas to be generating this nonsense i think theyre not doing it maliciously i think were observing the emergence of new religions how religions come because religions are about some controls
568,lee cronin, youve got the optimist saying ai is going to cure us all and ai is going to kill us all whats the reality well we dont have ai we have really powerful machine learning tools and they will allow us to do interesting things and we need to be careful about how we use those tools in terms of manipulating human beings and faking stuff right
569,lex fridman, right well let me try to steel man the ai doomers argument and actually i dont know are ai doomers in the yudkowsky camp saying its definitely going to kill us because theres a spectrum
570,lee cronin,  i think is the limit
571,lex fridman, plus plus thats the
572,lee cronin, no not plus i dont know i was seeing on twitter today various things but i think yudkowsky is at 
573,lex fridman, but to belong to the ai doomer club is there a threshold i dont know what the membership 
574,lee cronin, maybe
575,lex fridman, and what are the fees
576,lee cronin, well i think scott aronson i was quite surprised had put two  i saw this online so i could be wrong so sorry if its wrong he says  but the thing is if someone said theres a  chance that youre going to die going into the lift would you go into the lift
577,lex fridman, in the elevator for the american englishspeaking audience well no not for the elevator
578,lee cronin, so i would say anyone higher than   i think theres a  chance of agi doom zero
579,lex fridman, just to push back on the argument where n of zero on the agi  we could see on earth that theres increasing levels of intelligence of organisms we can see what humans with extra intelligence were able to do to the other species so that is a lot of samples of data what a delta in intelligence gives you when you have an increase in intelligence how youre able to dominate a species on earth
580,lex fridman, so the idea there is that if you have a being thats x smarter than humans were not going to be able to predict what that being is going to be able to do especially if it has the power to hurt humans which you can imagine a lot of trajectories in which the more benefit ai systems give the more control we give to those ai systems over our power grid over our nuclear weapons or weapons of any sort and then its hard to know what an ultraintelligence system would be able to do in that case you dont find that convincing
581,lee cronin, i think i would fail that argument  heres a number of reasons to fail it on first of all we dont know where the intention comes from the problem is that people keep  ive been watching all the hucksters online with the prompt engineering and all this stuff when i talk to a typical ai computer scientist they keep talking about the ais having some kind of decisionmaking ability that is a category error
582,lee cronin, the decisionmaking ability comes from human beings we have no understanding of how humans make decisions weve just been discussing free will for the last half an hour right we dont even know what that is so the intention i totally agree with you people who intend to do bad things can do bad things and we should not let that risk go thats totally here and now i do not want that to happen and im happy to be regulated to make sure that systems i generate whether theyre computer systems or  im working on a new project called chem machina
583,lex fridman, nice well done
584,lee cronin, yeah yeah which is basically a 
585,lex fridman, for people who dont understand the pun the ex machina is a great film about i guess agi embodied and chem is the chemistry version of that
586,lee cronin, and i only know one way to embody intelligence and thats in chemistry and human brains so category error number one is that they have agency category error number two is assuming that anything we make is going to be more intelligent now you didnt say superintelligent ill put the words into our mouths here superintelligent i think that there is no reason to expect that we are going to make systems that are more intelligent more capable 
587,lee cronin, when people play chess computers they dont expect to win now right the chess computer is very good at chess that doesnt mean its superintelligent so i think that superintelligence and i think even nick bostrom is pulling back on this now because he invented this  so i see this a lot when did i see it first happen eric drexler nanotechnology atomically precise machines he came up with a world where we had these atom cogs everywhere and we were going to make selfreplicating nanobots
588,lee cronin, not possible why because theres no resources to build these selfreplicating nanobots you cant get the precision it doesnt work it was a major category error in taking engineering principles down to the molecular level the only functioning nanomolecular technology we know is produced by evolution there
589,lee cronin, so now lets go forward to agi what is agi we dont know its super it can do this or humans cant think i would argue the only agis that exist in the universe are produced by evolution and sure we may be able to make our working memory better we might be able to do more things the human brain is the most compact computing unit in the universe it uses  watts uses a really limited volume its not like a chatgpt cluster which has to have thousands of watts and a model thats generated and it has to be corrected by human beings you are autonomous and embodied intelligence
590,lee cronin, so i think that there are so many levels that were missing out weve just kind of went oh weve discovered fire oh gosh the planets just going to burn one day randomly i just dont understand that leap there are bigger problems we need to worry about so what is the motivation why are these people and lets assume theyre earnest have this conviction well i think theyre making leaps and theyre trapped in a virtual reality that isnt reality
591,lex fridman, well i can continue a set of arguments here but also it is true that ideologies that fearmonger are dangerous because you can then use it to control to regulate in a way that halts progress to control people and to cancel people all that kind of stuff so you have to be careful because reason ultimately wins right
592,lex fridman, but there is a lot of concerns with superintelligent systems very capable systems i think when you hear the word superintelligent youre hearing its smarter than humans in every way that humans are smart but the paperclip manufacturing system doesnt need to be smart in every way it just needs to be smart in a set of specific ways and the more capable the ai systems become the more you could see us giving them control over like i said our power grid a lot of aspects of human life and then that means theyll be able to do more and more damage when theres unintended consequences that come to life
593,lee cronin, i think that thats right the unintended consequences we have to think about and that i fully agree with but lets go back a bit sentience  again im far away from my comfort zone and all this stuff but hey lets talk about it because i give myself a qualification
594,lex fridman, yeah were both qualified in sentience i think as much as anyone else
595,lee cronin, i think the paperclip scenario is just such a poor one because lets think about how that would happen and also lets think about we are being so unrealistic about how much of the earths surface we have commandeered for paperclip manufacturing to really happen do the math its not going to happen theres not enough energy theres not enough resource where is it all going to come from
596,lee cronin, i think that what happens in evolution its really why has a killer virus not killed all life on earth well what happens is sure superkiller viruses that kill the ribosome have emerged but you know what happens they nuke a small space because they cant propagate they all die so theres this interplay between evolution and propagation right and death so 
597,lex fridman, in evolution you dont think its possible to engineer for example and sorry to interrupt but a perfect virus
598,lee cronin, no
599,lex fridman, thats deadly enough
600,lee cronin, no nonsensical i think again it wouldnt work because if it was too deadly it would just kill the radius and not replicate
601,lex fridman, yeah but you dont think its possible to get a 
602,lee cronin, if you were 
603,lex fridman, not kill all of life on earth but kill all humans theres not many of us theres only like  billion theres so much more ants so many more ants and theyre pretty smart
604,lee cronin, i think the nice thing about where we are i would love for the ai crowd to take a leaf out of the book of the biowarfare chemical warfare crowd i mean not love because actually people have been killed with chemical weapons in the first and second world war and bioweapons have been made and we can argue about covid and all this stuff lets not go there just now but i think there is a consensus that some certain things are bad and we shouldnt do them right and sure it would be possible for a bad actor to engineer something bad but we would see it coming and we would be able to do something about it
605,lee cronin, now i guess what im trying to say is when people talk about doom and when you ask them for the mechanism they just make something up in this case im with yann lecun i think you put out a very good point about trying to regulate jet engines before weve even invented them and i think thats what im saying
606,lee cronin, im not saying we should  i just dont understand why these guys are going around literally making stuff up about us all dying when basically we need to actually really focus on  now lets say theres some actors that are earnest lets say yudkowsky is being earnest and he really cares but he loves it he goes da da da and then youre all going to die its like why dont we try and do the same thing and say you could do this and then youre all going to be happy forever after
607,lex fridman, well i think theres several things to say there one i think there is a role in society for people that say were all going to die because i think it filters through as a message as a viral message that gives us the proper amount of concern meaning its not  but when you say  and it filters through society itll give an average of like a  an average so its nice to have people that are like were all going to die and then well have a proper concern
608,lex fridman, for example i do believe were not properly concerned about the threat of nuclear weapons currently it just seems like people have forgotten that thats a thing and theres a war in ukraine with a nuclear power involved theres nuclear powers throughout the world and it just feels like war in the brink of a potential world war to a percentage that i dont think people are properly calibrating in their head were all thinking its a twitter battle as opposed to actual threat
609,lex fridman, so its nice to have that kind of level of concern but to me when i hear ai doomers what im imagining is with unintended consequences a potential situation where lets say  of the world suffers deeply because of a mistake made of unintended consequences i dont want to imagine the entirety of human civilization dying but there could be a lot of suffering if this is done poorly
610,lee cronin, i understand that and i guess im involved in the whole hype cycle so lets say having some people saying ai doom is a worry fine lets give them that but what seems to be happening is there seems to be people who dont think ai is doing that and theyre trying to use that to control regulation and to push people to regulate which stops humans generating knowledge and i am an advocate for generating as much knowledge as possible
611,lee cronin,nuclear weapons
612,lee cronin, when it comes to nuclear weapons i grew up in the s and s where there was nuclear doom and a lot of adults really had existential threat almost as bad as now with ai doom they were really worried there were some great  well not great there were some horrific documentaries i think there was one called threads that was generated in the uk which it was terrible it was so scary
613,lee cronin, and i think that the correct thing to do is obviously get rid of nuclear weapons but lets think about unintended consequences weve got rid of  this is going to be such a non sequitur we got rid of all the sulfur particles in the atmosphere right all the soot and whats happened in the last couple of years is global warming has accelerated because weve cleaned up the atmosphere too much so 
614,lex fridman, sure the same thing if you get rid of nuclear weapons youll get inaudible 
615,lee cronin, exactly thats my point so what we could do is if we actually started to put the ai in charge  which id really like an ai to be in charge of all world politics and this will sound ridiculous for a second hang on but if we could all agree on the
616,lex fridman, the ai doomers just woke up on that statement
617,lee cronin, yeah yeah yeah but i really dont like politicians who are basically just looking at local sampling but if you could say globally look heres some game theory here what is the minimum number of nuclear weapons we need to distribute around the world to everybody to basically reduce war to zero
618,lex fridman, just the thought experiment of the united states and china and russia and major nuclear powers get together and say all right were going to distribute nuclear weapons to every single nation on earth oh boy that has a probably greater than  chance of eliminating major military conflict but its not a hundred percent
619,lee cronin, but i dont think anyone will use them because  and look what youve got to try and do is to qualify for these nuclear weapons  this is a great idea the game theorists could do this right
620,lex fridman, uhhuh
621,lee cronin, i think the question is this  i really buy your question we have too many nukes just from a feeling point of view that weve got too many of them so lets reduce the number but not get rid of them because well have too much conventional warfare so then what is the minimum number of nuclear weapons we can distribute around to remove  humans hurting each other is something we should stop doing its not out with our conceptual capability 
622,lee cronin, but right now what about certain nations that are being exploited for their natural resources in the future for a shortterm gain because we dont want to generate knowledge so if everybody had an equal doomsday switch i predict the quality of life of the average human will go up faster i am an optimist and i believe that humanity is going to get better and better and better that were going to eliminate more problems but i think yeah lets
623,lex fridman, but the probability of a bad actor of one of the nations setting off a nuclear weapon you have to integrate that into the calculus here
624,lee cronin, but we just give you inaudible  nukes population right what we do is we  i cant believe this but anyway lets just go there so if a small nation with a couple of nukes uses one because theyre a bit bored or annoyed the likelihood that they are going to be pummeled out of existence immediately is  and yet theyve only nuked one other city i know this is crazy and i apologize for 
625,lex fridman, well no no just to be clear were just having a thought experiment thats interesting but theres terrorist organizations that would take that trade we have to ask ourselves a question of which percentage of humans would be suicide bombers essentially where they would sacrifice their own life because they hate another group of people i believe its a very small fraction but is it large enough to if you give out nuclear weapons 
626,lee cronin, i can predict a future where we take all nuclear material and we burn it for energy right because were getting there and the other thing you could do is say look theres a gap so if we get all the countries to sign up to the virtual agreement where we have a simulation where we can nuke each other in the simulation and the economic consequences are catastrophic 
627,lex fridman, sure in the simulation i love it its not going to kill all humans its just going to have economic consequences
628,lee cronin, yeah yeah i dont know i just made it up it seems like a cool idea
629,lex fridman, no its interesting but its interesting whether that would have as much power on human psychology as actual physical nuclear explosion
630,lee cronin, i think so
631,lex fridman, its possible but people dont take economic consequences as seriously i think as actual nuclear weapons exploding
632,lee cronin, i think they do in argentina and they do in somalia and they do in a lot of these places where  no i think this is a great idea im a strong advocate now for  so what have we come up with burning all the nuclear material to have energy and before we do that because mad is good mutually assured destruction is very powerful lets take it into the metaverse and then get people to kind of subscribe to that and if they actually nuke each other even for fun in the metaverse there are dire consequences
633,lex fridman, yeah yeah so its like a video game we all have to join this metaverse video game 
634,lee cronin, yeah i cant believe we just 
635,lex fridman, and then theres dire economic consequences and its all run by ai as you mentioned so the ai doomers are really terrified at this point
636,lee cronin, no theyre happy they have a job for another  years right
637,lex fridman, oh fearmongering
638,lee cronin, yeah yeah yeah im a believer in equal employment
639,lee cronin,chem machina
640,lex fridman, youve mentioned that whatd you call it  chem machina
641,lee cronin, yeah
642,lex fridman, yeah so youve mentioned that a chemical brain is something youre interested in creating and thats the way to get conscious ai soon can you explain what a chemical brain is
643,lee cronin, i want to understand the mechanism of intelligence thats gone through evolution right because the way that intelligence was produced by evolution appears to be the following origin of life multicellularity locomotion senses once you can start to see things coming towards you and you can remember the past and interrogate the present and imagine the future you can do something amazing right and i think only in recent years did humans become turingcomplete right
644,lex fridman, yeah
645,lee cronin, right so that turing completeness kind of gave us another kick up but our ability to process that information was produced in a wet brain and i think that we do not have the correct hardware architectures to have the domain flexibility and the ability to integrate information and i think intelligence also comes at a massive compromise of data right now were obsessing about getting more and more data more and more processing more and more tricks to get dopamine hits so when we look back on this going oh yeah that was really cool because when i asked chatgpt it made me feel really happy and i got a hit from it but actually it just exposed how little intelligence i use in every moment because im easily fooled
646,lee cronin, so what i would like to do is to say well hey hang on what is it about the brain so the brain has this incredible connectivity and it has the ability to  as i said earlier about my nephew i went from bill to billy and he went all right leroy how did he make that leap that he was able to basically without any training  i extended his name in a way that he doesnt like he wants to be called bill he went back and said you like to be called lee im going to call you leroy
647,lee cronin, so human beings have a brilliant ability or intelligent beings appear to have a brilliant ability to integrate across all domains all at once and to synthesize something which allows us to generate knowledge and becoming turingcomplete on our own although ais are built and turingcomplete things their thinking is not turingcomplete in that they are not able to build universal explanations and that lack of universal explanation means that theyre just
648,lee cronin, lack of universal explanation means that theyre just inductivists inductivism doesnt get you anywhere its just basically a party trick i think its in the fabric of reality from david deutsch where basically the farmer is feeding the chicken every day and the chickens getting fat and happy and the chickens like im really happy every time the farmer comes in and feeds me and then one day the farmer comes in and instead of feeding the chicken just rings its neck and had the chicken had an alternative understanding of why the farmer was feeding it
649,lex fridman, its interesting though because we dont know whats special about the human mind thats able to come up with these kind of generalities this universal theories of things and well come up with novelty i can imagine because you gave an example about william and leroy i feel like an example like that well be able to see in future versions of large language models well be really really really impressed by the humor the insights all of it because its fundamentally trained on all the incredible humor and insights thats available out there on the internet so well be impressed i think well be impressed
650,lee cronin, oh im impressed im impressed
651,lex fridman, increasingly so
652,lee cronin, but we are mining the past
653,lex fridman, yes
654,lee cronin, and what the human brain appears to be able to do is mine the future
655,lex fridman, yes so novelty it is interesting whether these large language models will ever be able to come up with something truly novel
656,lee cronin, i can show on the back of a piece of paper why thats impossible and its like the problem is that and again these are domain experts kind of bullshitting each other the term generative right average person say oh its no no no look if i take the numbers between zero and  and i train a model to pick out the prime numbers by giving all the prime numbers between zero and a thousand it doesnt know what prime number is occasionally if i can cheat a bit it will start to guess
657,lee cronin, it never will produce anything out with the dataset because you mine the past the thing that im getting to is i think that actually current machine learning technologies might actually help reveal why time is fundamental its like kind of insane because they tell you about whats happened in the past but they can never help you understand whats happening in the future without training examples sure if that thing happens again so lets think about what large language models are doing we have all the internet as we know it language but also theyre doing something else we having human beings correcting it all the time those models are being corrected
658,lex fridman, steered
659,lee cronin, corrected modified tweaked
660,lex fridman, well yeah but
661,lee cronin, cheating
662,lex fridman, well you could say the training on human data in the first place is cheating
663,lee cronin, well human is in the loop sorry to interrupt
664,lex fridman, yes so human is definitely in the loop but its not just human is in the loop a very large collection of humans is in the loop
665,lee cronin, look i totally
666,lex fridman, and that could be i mean to me its not intuitive that you said prime numbers that the system cant generate an algorithm that the algorithm that can generate prime numbers or the algorithm that can tell you if a number is prime and so on and generate algorithms that generate algorithms that generate algorithms that start to look a lot like human reasoning
667,lee cronin, i think again we can show that on a piece of paper that sure i think you have to have so this is the failure in epidemiology im glad i even can say that word let know what it means
668,lex fridman, you said it multiple times
669,lee cronin, i know its like three times now
670,lex fridman, without failure quit while youre ahead just dont say it again because you did really well
671,lee cronin, thanks but i think so what is reasoning so coming back to the chemical brain if i could show the inner because i mean im never going to make an intelligence in ca machina because if you dont have brain cells they dont have glial cells they dont have neurons but if i can take a gel and engineer the gel to have it be a hybrid hardware for reprogramming which i think i know how to do i will able to process a lot more information and train models billions of times cheaper and use cross domain knowledge and theres certain techniques i think we can do but theres still missing though the abilities that human beings have had to become true and complete and so i guess the question to give back at you is like how do you tell the difference between trial and error and the generation of new knowledge
672,lee cronin, i think the way you can do it is this is that you come up with a theory an explanation inspiration comes from out and then you then test that and then you see thats going towards the truth and human beings are very good at doing that and the transition between philosophy mathematics physics and natural sciences and i think that we can see that where i get confused is why people misappropriate the term artificial intelligence to say hey theres something else going on here because i think you and i both agree machine learnings really good its only going to get better were going to get happier with the outcome but why would you ever think the model is thinking or reasoning reasoning requires intention and the intention if the model isnt reasoning the intentions come from the prompter and the intention has come from the person who programmed it to do it
673,lex fridman, but dont you think you can prompt it to have intentionbasically start with the initial conditions and get it going where currently large language models chatgpt only talks to you when you talk to it theres no reason why you cant just start it talking
674,lee cronin, but those initial conditions came from someone starting it
675,lex fridman, yes
676,lee cronin, and that causal chain in there so that intention comes from the outside i think that there is something in that causal chain of intention thats super important i dont disagree were going to get to agi its a matter of when and what hardware i think were not going to do it in this hardware and i think were unnecessarily fetishizing really cool outputs and dopamine hits because obviously thats what people want to sell us
677,lex fridman, well but there could be agi is a loaded term but there could be incredibly super impressive intelligence systems on the way to agi so these large language models i mean if it appears conscious if it appears super intelligent who are we to say its not
678,lee cronin, i agree but the super intelligence i want i want to be able to have a discussion with it about coming up with fundamental new ideas that generate knowledge and if the superintelligent we generate can mine novel even from the future that i didnt see in its training set in the past i would agree that something really interesting is coming on ill say that again if the intelligence system be it a human being a chatbot something else is able to produce something truly novel that i could not predict even having full audit trail from the past then ill be sold
679,lex fridman, well so we should be clear that it can currently produce things that are in a shallow sense novel that are not in the training set but youre saying truly novel
680,lee cronin, i think they are in the training set i think everything it produces comes from a training set theres a difference between novelty and interpolation we do not understand where these leaps come from yet that is what intelligence is i would argue those leaps and some people say no its actually just what will happen if you just do cross domain training and all that stuff and that may be true and i may be completely wrong but right now the human mind is able to mine novelty in a way that artificial intelligence systems cannot and this is why we still all have a job and were still doing staff and i used chatgpt for a few weeks oh this is cool and then what happened is it took me too much time to correct it then it got really good and now theyve done something to it its not actually that good
681,lex fridman, yeah right
682,lee cronin, i dont know whats going on
683,lex fridman, censorship yeah i mean thats interesting but it will push us humans to characterize novelty better characterize the novel what is novel what is truly novel whats the difference between novelty and interpolation
684,lee cronin, i think that this is the thing that makes me most excited about these technologies is theyre going to help me demonstrate to you that time is fundamental and the unit future is bigger than the present which is why human beings are quite good at generating novelty because we have to expand our dataset and to cope with unexpected things in our environment our environment throws them all at us again we have to survive in that environment and i mean i never say never i would be very interested in how we can get cross domain training cheaply in chemical systems because im a chemist and bray the only sim thing i know of is a human brain but maybe thats just me being boring and predictable and not novel
685,lee cronin,gpt for electron density
686,lex fridman, yeah you mentioned gpt for electron density so a gpt like system for generating molecules that can bind to host automatically i mean thats interesting is really interesting applying this same kind of transform mechanism
687,lee cronin, i mean my team i try and do things that are non obvious but non obvious in certain areas and one of the things i was always asking about in chemistry people like to represent molecules as graphs and its quite difficult its really hard if youre doing ai and chemistry you really want to basically have good representations you can generate new molecules are interesting and i was thinking well molecules arent really graphs and theyre not continuously differentiable could i do something that was continuously differentiable i was like well molecules are actually made up of electron density so i got thinking and say well okay could there be a way where we could just basically take a database of readily solved electron densities for millions of molecules so we took the electron density for millions of molecules and just train the model to learn what electron density is
688,lee cronin, and so what we built was a system that you literally could give it a lets say you could take a protein that has a particular active site or a cup with a certain hole in it you pour noise into it and with a gpt you turn the noise into electron density and then in this case it hallucinates like all of them do but then hallucinations are good because it means i dont have to train on such a huge dataset because these data sets are very expensive how do you produce it so go back a step so youve got all these molecules in this dataset but what youve literally done is a quantum mechanical calculation we produce electron densities for each molecule so you say oh this representation of this molecule has these electron densities associated with it so you know what the representation is and you train the neural network to know what electron density is
689,lee cronin, so then you give it an unknown pocket you pour in noise and you say right produce me electron density it produces electron density that doesnt look ridiculous and what we did in this case is we produce electron density that maximizes the electrostatic potential so the stickiness but minimizes what we call the steric hindrance so the overlaps so its repulsive so make the perfect fit and then we then use kind of like a chatgpt type thing to turn that electron density into whats called a smile a smile string is a way of representing a molecule in letters and then we can then
690,lex fridman, so it just generates them then
691,lee cronin, just generates them and then the other thing is then we bung that into the computer and then it just makes it
692,lex fridman, yeah the computer being the thing that right to generate
693,lee cronin, the robot weve got that can basically just do chemistry so weve kind of got this endtoend drug discovery machine where you can say oh you want to bind to this active site here you go i mean it is a bit leaky and things kind of break but it is the proof of principle
694,lex fridman, but were the hallucinations are those still accurate
695,lee cronin, well the hallucinations are really great in this case because in the case of a large language model the hallucinations just make everything up it doesnt just make everything up but it gives you an output that you are plausibly comfortable with and thinks youre doing probabilistically the problem on these tron density models is its very expensive to solve a shredding equation going up to many heavy atoms and large molecules and so we wondered if we trained the system on up to nine heavy atoms whether it would go beyond nine and it did it started to generate molecules for  no problem they look pretty good and i was like well this hallucination i will take for free thank you very much
696,lee cronin, because it just basically this is a case where interpolation extrapolation worked relatively well and we were able to generate the really good molecules and then what we were able to do here is and this is a really good point and what i was trying to say earlier that we were able to generate new molecules from the known set that would bind to the host so a new guest would bind were these truly novel not really because they were constrained by the host were they new to us yes so i do well understand i can concede that machine learning systems artificial intelligence systems can generate new entities but how novel are they it remains to be seen
697,lex fridman, and how novel the things that humans generate is also difficult to quantify they seem novel
698,lee cronin, thats what a lot of people say so the way to really get to genuine novelty and assembly theory shows you the way is to have different causal chains overlap and this really really resonates with the time is fundamental argument and if you are bringing together a couple of objects with different initial conditions coming together when they interact the more different their histories the more novelty they generate in time going forward and so it could be that genuine novelty is basically about mix it up a little and the human brain is able to mix it up a little little and all that stimulus comes from the environment but all i think im saying is the universe is deterministic going back in time nondeterministic going forward in time because the universe is too big in the future to contain in the present therefore these collisions of known things generate unknown things that then become part of your data set and dont appear weird thats how we give ourselves comfort the past looks consistent with this initial condition hypothesis but actually were generating more and more novelty and thats how it works simple
699,lex fridman, so its hard to quantify novelty looking backwards i mean the present and the future at the novelty generators
700,lee cronin, but i like this whole idea of mining novelty i think it is going to reveal why the limitations of current ai is a bit like a printing press everyone thought that when the printing press came that writing books is going to be terrible that you had evil spirits and all this they were just books
701,lex fridman, and same with ai but i think just the scale you can achieve in terms of impact with ai systems is pretty nerve wracking
702,lee cronin, but thats what the big companies want you to think
703,lex fridman, but not in terms of destroy all humans but you can have major consequences in the way social media has had major consequences both positive and negative and so you have to think about it and worry about it but yeah people that fear monger
704,lee cronin, my pet theory for this you want to know
705,lex fridman, yeah
706,lee cronin, is i think that a lot and maybe im being and i really do respect a lot of the people out there who are trying to have discourse about the positive future so open ai guys meta guys and all this what i wonder if theyre trying to cover up for the fact that social media has had a pretty disastrous effect at some level and theyre just trying to say oh yeah we should do this covering up for the fact that we have got some problems with teenagers and instagram and snapchat and all this stuff and maybe theyre just overreacting now its like oh yeah sorry we made the bubonic plate and gave it to you all and youre all dying and oh yeah but look at this over here its even worse
707,lex fridman, yeah theres a little bit of that but theres also not enough celebration of the positive impact that all of these technologies have had we tend to focus on the negative and tend to forget that in part because its hard to measure it is very hard to measure the positive impact social media had on the world
708,lee cronin, yeah i agree but what i worry about right now is i do care about the ethics of what were doing and one of the reasons why im so open about the things were trying to do in the lab make life look at intelligence all this so people say what are the consequences of this and you say what are the consequences of not doing it and i think that what worries me right now in the present is lack of authenticated users and authenticated data and
709,lex fridman, human users
710,lee cronin, yeah human
711,lex fridman, i still think that there will be ai agents that appear to be conscious but they would have to be also authenticated and labeled as such theres too much value in that like friendships with ai systems theres too much meaningful human experiences to have with the ai systems that i just
712,lee cronin, but thats like a tool right its a bit like a meditation tool right
713,lex fridman, sure
714,lee cronin, some people have a meditation tool it makes them feel better but im not sure you can ascribe sentience and legal rights to a chatbot that makes you feel less lonely
715,lex fridman, sentience yes i think legal rights no i think its the same you can have a really deep meaningful relationship with a dog
716,lee cronin, well the dog is sentient
717,lex fridman, yes
718,lee cronin, the chatbots right now using the technology we use its not going to be sentient
719,lee cronin,god
720,lex fridman, this is going to be a fun continued conversation on twitter that i look forward to since youve had also from another place some debates that were inspired by the assembly theory paper let me ask you about god is there any room for notions of god in assembly theory of god
721,lee cronin, yeah i dont know what god is a i mean so god exists in our mind created by selection so the human beings have created the concept of god in the same way that human beings have created the concept of super intelligence
722,lex fridman, sure but does it mean does it not it still could mean that thats a projection from the real world where were just assigning words and concepts to a thing that is fundamental to the real world that there is something out there that is a creative force underlying the universe
723,lee cronin, i think the universe there is a creative force in the universe but i dont think its sentient so i do not understand the universe so who am i to say that god doesnt exist i am an atheist but im not an angry atheist theres some people i know that are angry atheists and say
724,lex fridman, cranky
725,lee cronin, say that religious people are stupid i dont think thats the case i have faith in some things i mean when i was a kid i was like i need to know what the charge of electron is and i was like i cant measure the charge on electron i just gave up and had faith okay you know resistors worked so when it comes to i want to know why the universe is growing in the future and what humanity is going to become and ive seen that the acquisition of knowledge via the generation of novelty to produce technology has uniformly made humans lives better i would love to continue that tradition
726,lex fridman, you said that theres that creative force do you think just to think on that point do you think theres a creative force is there like a thing like a driver thats creating stuff
727,lee cronin, yeah so i think that
728,lex fridman, and where what is it can you describe it mathematically
729,lee cronin, well i think selection i think selection
730,lex fridman, selection is the force
731,lee cronin, selection is the force in the universe it creates novelty
732,lex fridman, so is selection somehow fundamental like what
733,lee cronin, yeah i think persistence of objects that could decay into nothing through operations that maintain that structure i mean think about it its amazing that things exist at all that were just not a big commentorial mess
734,lex fridman, yes
735,lee cronin, so the fact that
736,lex fridman, and exist a thing that exists persist in time
737,lee cronin, yeah lets think maybe the universe is actually in the present the things everything that can exist in the present does exist
738,lex fridman, well that would mean its deterministic right
739,lee cronin, i think the universes might so the universe started super small the past was deterministic there wasnt much going on and it was able to mine mine mine mine mine and so the process is somehow generating universes basically im trying to put this into words
740,lex fridman, did you just say theres no free will though
741,lee cronin, no i didnt say that
742,lex fridman, as if
743,lee cronin, sorry sorry sorry
744,lex fridman, it can exist
745,lee cronin, i said there is free will im saying that free will occurs at the boundary between the
746,lex fridman, the past and the future
747,lee cronin, the past and the future
748,lex fridman, yeah i got you but everything that can exist does exist
749,lee cronin, so everything thats possible to exist at this so no im really pulling this
750,lex fridman, theres a lot of loaded words there theres a time element loaded into that statement
751,lee cronin, i think that the universe is able to do what it can in the present right
752,lex fridman, yeah
753,lee cronin, and then i think in the future there are other things that could be possible we can imagine lots of things but they dont all happen
754,lex fridman, sure
755,lee cronin, so what
756,lex fridman, so thats where
757,lee cronin, so thats what i guess im getting to
758,lex fridman, you sneak in free will right there
759,lee cronin, yeah so i guess what im saying is what exists is a convolution of the past with the present and the free will going into the future
760,lex fridman, well we could still imagine stuff right we can imagine stuff that will never happen
761,lee cronin, and its amazing force because this is the most important thing that we dont understand is our imaginations can actually change the future in a tangible way which is what the initial conditions and physics cannot predict your imagination has a causal consequence in the future
762,lex fridman, isnt that weird to you
763,lee cronin, yeah it breaks the laws of physics as we know them right now
764,lex fridman, so you think the imagination has a causal effect on the future
765,lee cronin, yeah
766,lex fridman, but it does exist in there in the head
767,lee cronin, it does but
768,lex fridman, there must be a lot of power in whatevers going on there could be a lot of power whatevers going on in there
769,lee cronin, if we then go back to the initial conditions and that is simply not possible that can happen but if we go into a universe where we accept that there is a finite ability to represent numbers and you have rounding well not rounding errors you have sum what happens your ability to make decisions imagine and do stuff is that that interface between the certain and the uncertain its not as yashar was saying to me randomness goes and you just randomly do random stuff it is that you are set free a little on your trajectory free will is about being able to explore on this narrow trajectory that allows you to build you have a choice about what you build or that choice is you interacting with a future in the present
770,lex fridman, what to you is most beautiful about this whole thing the universe
771,lee cronin, the fact it seems to be very undecided very open the fact that every time i think im getting towards an answer to a question there are so many more questions that make the chase
772,lex fridman, do you hate that its going to be over at some point for you
773,lee cronin, no well for me i think if you think about it is it over for newton now newton has had causal consequences in the future we discuss him all the time
774,lex fridman, his ideas but not the person
775,lee cronin, the person just had a lot of causal power when he was alive but oh my god one of the things i want to do is leave as many easter eggs in the future when im gone to go oh thats cool
776,lex fridman, would you be very upset if somebody made a good large language model thats fine tuned to lee cronin
777,lee cronin, it would be quite boring because i mean i
778,lex fridman, no novelty generation
779,lee cronin, i mean if its a faithful representation of what ive done in my life thats great thats an interesting artifact but i think the most interesting thing about knowing each other is we dont know what were going to do next
780,lex fridman, sure sure
781,lee cronin, i mean within some constraints ive got i can predict some things about you you can predict some things about me but we cant predict everything
782,lex fridman, everything
783,lee cronin, and its because we cant predict everything is why were exciting to come back and discuss and see so yeah im happy that itll be interesting that some things that ive done can be captured but im pretty sure that my angle on mining novelty for the future will not be captured
784,lex fridman, yeah yeah so thats what life is is just some novelty generation and then youre done each one of us just generally a little bit or have the capacity to at least
785,lee cronin, i think life is a selection produces life and life affects a universe universes with life in them are materially physically fundamentally different than universes without life and thats super interesting and i have no beginnings of understanding i think maybe this is in a thousand years therell be a new discipline and the humans will be like yeah of course this is how it all works right
786,lex fridman, in retrospect itll all be obvious i think
787,lee cronin, i think assembly theory is obvious thats why a lot of people got angry they were like oh my god this is such nonsense and like oh actually its not quite but the writings really bad
788,lex fridman, well i cant wait to see where it evolves lee and i am glad i get to exist in this universe with you youre a fascinating human this is always a pleasure i hope to talk to you many more times and im a huge fan of just watching you create stuff in this world and thank you for talking today
789,lee cronin, its a pleasure as always lex thanks for having me on
790,lex fridman, thanks for listening to this conversation with lee cronin to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from carl sagan we can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
